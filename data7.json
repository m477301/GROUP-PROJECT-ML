In her innovative exploration of national imagination in the Bible, Pardes highlights the textual manifestations of the metaphor, the many anthropomorphisms by which a collective character named Israel springs to life. She explores the representation of communal motives, hidden desires, collective anxieties, the drama and suspense embedded in each phase of the nation's life: from birth in exile, to suckling in the wilderness, to a long process of maturation that has no definite end. In the Bible, Pardes suggests, history and literature go hand in hand more explicitly than in modern historiography, which is why the Bible serves as a paradigmatic case for examining the narrative base of national constructions.  Pardes calls for a consideration of the Bible's penetrating renditions of national ambivalence. She reads the rebellious conduct of the nation against the grain, probing the murmurings of the people, foregrounding their critique of the official line. The Bible does not provide a homogeneous account of nation formation, according to Pardes, but rather reveals points of tension between different perceptions of the nation's history and destiny.  This fresh and beautifully rendered portrayal of the history of ancient Israel will be of vital interest to anyone interested in the Bible, in the interrelations of literature and history, in nationhood, in feminist thought, and in psychoanalysis.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History"], "author": "Ilana Pardes", "rating": "3.64", "pages": "224"}, {"id": 2200029, "title": "Your Relationship with God: Drawing Closer to God Every Day", "blurb": "When life doesn't work out the way we expect it to, we often grow angry and bitter.

But for those Jews who settled in western cities and towns, this epic played only a minor role. To the land between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean came a steady stream of Jewish men and women. Between 1850 and the 1920s the Jewish population of the western United States grew from a number too small to count to an estimated 300,000 people. This book explores the birth of an American Jewish culture that had only tenuous roots in the East. By examining the life experiences of Jewish men and women who migrated to the West overland and by sea, by covered wagon, ship, and train, who settled in cities and on farms, and who became leaders in the Jewish and larger secular community, this book reveals the contrast between the American image of Jews as eastern urbanites and the reality of the diversity of American Jewish life. The contributors to this volume focus on Jewish settlement in the American West during the era of the Great Migration from the 1840s to the 1920s.  Much of the Jewish story in the West is one of shared experience with non-Jews, based on the many needs people have in common. The essential differences were those of belief and issues of conflict born of bias. The West has always been a land filled with a great variety of environments, resources, and people. There was room for Jewish people along with the hordes of others with differing languages, beliefs, and origins.  Ava F.

Thus Walter Gropius, one of the pioneers of modern architecture, on the radical departures of the 20th century. In the 1930s, the term International Style came into use to describe a new form of architecture evolved from Bauhaus and its conviction that form follows function. Until the 1980s, International Style set the standard in modern building, with its logical formal idiom and rational solutions to construction problems. Combining steel, glass and concrete, it established an aesthetic founded on the sheer thrill of pushing to the limits of technical and economic viability. Hence the exhil-arating skylines of metropolises worldwide - but also the desolate anonymity of modern suburban environments. This book traces the exciting evolution of a style while examining the individual and regional forms it took, and analyses the ideals and realities of architectural visions of utopia.

It encompasses royal feasts and street food, the skinning of eels and the making of strawberry jelly, mixing tales of culinary stars with those of the invisible hordes cooking in kitchens across the land. Beginning before Roman times, the book journeys through the ingredients, equipment, kitchens, feasts, fads, and famines of the British. It covers the piquancy of Norman cuisine, the influx of undreamed-of spices and new foods from the East and the New World, the Tudor pumpkin pie that journeyed with the founding fathers to become America's national dish, the austerity of rationing during World War II, and the birth of convenience foods and take-away, right up to the age of Nigella Lawson, Heston Blumenthal, and Jamie Oliver. The first trade book to tell the story of British cooking-which is, of course, the history that led up to American colonial cooking as well-Taste shows that kitchens are not only places of steam, oil, and sweat, but of politics, invention, cultural exchange, commerce, conflict, and play.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Food and Drink", "Food", "Nonfiction", "History", "Food History", "Food and Drink", "Cookbooks", "Food and Drink", "Cooking", "Food and Drink", "Historical", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Food and Drink", "Food Writing"], "author": "Kate Colquhoun", "rating": "3.92", "pages": "460"}, {"id": 2204021, "title": "Sharing Our Worlds: An Introduction to Cultural and Social Anthropology", "blurb": "Sharing Our Worlds offers the perfect introduction to cultural and social anthropology for anyone approaching the subject for the first time.

The conservative bias of the field and its enshrined knowledge make it difficult to introduce new ideas not in line with received theory. Happiness research, however, has the potential to change economics substantially in the future. Its findings, which are gradually being taken into account in standard economics, can be considered revolutionary in three respects: the measurement of experienced utility using psychologists' tools for measuring subjective well-being; new insights into how human beings value goods and services and social conditions that include consideration of such non-material values as autonomy and social relations; and policy consequences of these new insights that suggest different ways for government to affect individual well-being. In Happiness, emphasizing empirical evidence rather than theoretical conjectures, Bruno Frey substantiates these three revolutionary claims for happiness research. After tracing the major developments of happiness research in economics and demonstrating that we have gained important new insights into how income, unemployment, inflation, and income demonstration affect well-being, Frey examines such wide-ranging topics as democracy and federalism, self-employment and volunteer work, marriage, terrorism, and watching television from the new perspective of happiness research. Turning to policy implications, Frey describes how government can provide the conditions for people to achieve well-being, arguing that a crucial role is played by adequate political institutions and decentralized decision making.

Now, two years later, he reaffirms his mastery of shorter fiction with his first collection since the widely acclaimed Rock Springs, published a decade ago.The landscape of Women with Men ranges from the northern plains of Montana to the streets of Paris and the suburbs of Chicago, where Mr. Ford's various characters experience the consolations and complications that prevail in matters of passion, romance and love. A seventeen-year-old boy starting adulthood in the shadow of his parents' estrangement, a survivor of three marriages now struggling with cancer, an ostensibly devoted salesman in early middle age, an aspiring writer, a woman scandalously betrayed by her husband--they each of them contend with the vast distances that exist between those who are closest together. Whether alone, long married or newly met, they confront the obscure difference between privacy and intimacy, the fine distinction of pleasing another as opposed to oneself, and a need for reliance that is tempered by fearful vulnerability.In three long stories, Richard Ford captures men and women at this complex and essential moment of truth--in the course of everyday life, or during a bleak Thanksgiving journey, seismic arguments, Christmas abroad, the sudden disappearance of a child, even a barroom shooting. And with peerless emotional nuance and authority he once again demonstrates, as Elizabeth Hardwick has written, a talent as strong and varied as American fiction has to offer.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Literature", "American", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "Love", "American", "American Fiction", "Relationships", "Literature", "Romance"], "author": "Richard Ford", "rating": "3.65", "pages": null}, {"id": 2205788, "title": "The Transfer Agreement", "blurb": "The Transfer Agreement is the stunning, compassionate account of the deal with the devil that saved 60,000 Jews from the Holocaust.

This is Genji as read and loved by a person of a truly contemporary sensibility. -J. Thomas Rimer, University of Maryland. Foremost among Japanese literary classics and one of the world's earliest novels, the Tale of Genji was written around the year A. D. 1000 by Murasaki Shikibu, a woman from a declining aristocratic family. For sophistication and insight, Western prose fiction was to wait centuries to rival her work. Norma Field explores the shifting configurations of the Tale, showing how the hero Genji is made and unmade by a series of heroines. Professor Field draws on the riches of both Japanese and Western Scholarship, as well as on her own sensitive reading of the Tale. Included are discussions of the social, psychological, and political dimensions of the aesthetics of this novel, with emphasis on the crucial relationship of erotic and political concerns to prose fictions.

Wilkins states that the discipline of architecture has a resistance to African Americans at every level, from the startlingly small number of architecture students to the paltry number of registered architects in the United States today.Working to understand how ideologies are formed, transmitted, and embedded in the built environment, Wilkins deconstructs how the marginalization of African Americans is authorized within the field of architecture. He then outlines how activist forms of expression shape and sustain communities, fashioning an architectural theory around the site of environmental conflict constructed by hip-hop culture.Wilkins places his concerns in a historical context, and also offers practical solutions to address them.

And in the three years since that fateful day, he has come to a sobering realization: Our once-noble news media -- and network TV news in particular -- have abdicated their responsibility to the American people, and endangered us in the process.As Fenton points out, much of the United States still depends on the networks for most of its information about the world. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, the networks gutted their news-gathering operations -- just as the old Cold War status quo was shattering -- leaving behind an unstable and violent new world order. Once a public service, the network news was commandeered by its corporate parents as a cash cow. In-depth reporting on critical issues was replaced with saturation coverage of sensationalistic crime stories and simpleminded news you can use. Even as genocide spread through Africa -- and Islamic terror festered in the Middle East -- international reporting disappeared almost entirely from the airwaves. And Americans were left uninformed, unable to judge the accuracy of politically biased stories (on both sides of the spectrum), and utterly unprepared for the war on terror about to descend on their doorstep.In Bad News, Tom Fenton offers a fiery indictment of just how far the news has fallen. As a frequent voice in the wilderness himself -- who fought in vain to interest CBS in an Osama bin Laden interview in the 1990s -- Fenton reveals a news-gathering environment gutted by corporate bottom-lining bottom-feeders, staffed by dilatory producers and executives (who dismissed important stories as depressing or obscure), and dangerously dependent on images and information gathered by third-party sources. In hard-hitting interviews with Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, and Tom Brokaw, he exposes how even the anchors themselves believed they were outlandishly compensated -- while quality coverage was being slashed. And he charges that the news media must lose its entertainment-industry mindset and reestablish its role as a keeper of the public trust.This is not just a book, writes Fenton.

That they were in large part unsuccessful is evidenced by the survival of a number of documents written in Maya and preserved and added to by literate Mayas up to the 1830s. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel is such a document, literally the history of Yucatan written by and for Mayas, and it contains much information not available from Spanish sources because it was part of an underground resistance movement of which the Spanish were largely unaware. Well known to Mayanists, The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel is presented here in Munro S. Edmonson's English translation, extensively annotated. Edmonson reinterprets the book as literature and as history, placing it in chronological order and translating it as poetry. The ritual nature of Mayan history clearly emerges and casts new light on Mexican and Spanish acculturation of the Yucatecan Maya in the post-Classic and colonial periods. Centered in the city of Merida, the Chumayel provides the western (Xiu) perspective on Yucatecan history, as Edmonson's earlier book The Ancient Future of the Itza: The Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin presented the eastern (Itza) viewpoint. Both document the changing calendar of the colonial period and the continuing vitality of pre-Columbian ritual thought down to the nineteenth century. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the survival of the long-count dating system down to the Baktun Ceremonial of 1618 (12.0.0.0.0). But there are others: the use of rebus writing, the survival of the tun until 1752, graphic if oblique accounts of Mayan ceremonial drama, and the depiction of the Spanish conquest as a long-term inter-Mayan civil war.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Poetry", "Religion"], "author": "Anonymous", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "309"}, {"id": 2211179, "title": "The Daybreakers", "blurb": "Orrin Sackett had to be pushed into a fight.

In this ground-breaking book, the author questions this assumption and advances the debate through an empirical analysis of masculinity in the revealing contexts of same-sex (football and polo) and cross-sex (tango) relations. Because of its rich history, Argentina provides the ideal setting in which to study the intersection of masculine and national constructs: hybridization, creolization and a culture of performance have all informed both gender and national identities. Further, the author argues that, counter to claims made by globalization theorists, the importance of performance to Argentinian men and women has a long history and has powerfully shaped the national psyche.But this book takes the analysis far beyond national boundaries to address general arguments in anthropology which are not culture-specific, and the discussion poses important comparative questions and addresses central theoretical issues, from the interplay of morality and ritual, to a comparison between the popular and the aristocratic, to the importance of 'othering' in national constructions - particularly those relating to sport.This book represents a major contribution, not only to anthropology, but to the study of gender, nationalism and culture in its broadest sense.", "genre": ["Feminism"], "author": "Eduardo P.

A central thesis of the book is that Plato had a theology\u2014not just a mythology for the ideal city, not just the theory of forms or the theory of cosmic souls, but also, irreducible to any of these, an account of God as Nous (Reason), the source of rational order both to souls and the world of bodies. The understanding of God as Reason, and of the world as governed directly or indirectly by Reason, is worked out in the dialogues of Plato\u2019s last period, the Statesman, Philebus, Timaeus, and Laws. These dialogues offer a strategy for explaining the physical world that goes beyond anything in the middle dialogues, and gives the best starting point for understanding the cosmologies and theologies of Aristotle, the Stoics, and later ancient thinkers.Menn focuses on the Timaeus as Plato\u2019s most sustained effort to provide what (according to the Phaedo) Anaxagoras had failed to deliver: an explanation of the world through Reason, showing that things are as they are because it is best, or because it best serves the order of the world as a whole. Anaxagoras was disappointed because he explained things through their material constituents, without explaining why the constituents are ordered as they are; but the theory of forms has the same defect, since itcannot explain why different parts of the universe participate in different forms according to a particular order. The Timaeus and other late dialogues attempt to supply the missing explanation of the ordering of the physical world. These dialogues do not retreat from the middle dialogue theory of forms, nor do they escape into an esoteric theory of numbers; but they add to the middle dialogues an analysis of the principles necessary to account for the existence and partial intelligibility of the sensible world\u2014not only forms and a material substance but also Nous and souls.Although the demiurge of the Timaeus (and his counterpart the Nous of Philebus) is represented as a cause both to souls and bodies, most scholars have been reluctant to identify the demiurge as a being separate from and superior to souls, because they think that both the meaning of the Greek word nous and Plato\u2019s own statements require that Nous iseither a kind of soul (mind or rational soul) or something inseparable from souls (rational mental activity). Reexamining the linguistic evidence and the Platonic texts, Menn argues that nous can mean something separate from souls, namely the virtue of rationality or intelligence that souls participate in. Menn argues that Anaxagoras\u2019 Nous should be construed as such a virtue; then he examines what status this virtue has in the context of the Platonic theory of forms, and how itis a cause both to souls and to bodies. Soul plays a crucial role in mediating the causality of Nous and introducing rational order into the world of bodies, but neither soul in general nor the world-soul in particular can be identified with Nous.Menn stresses the pre-Socratic context for the cosmology and theology of Plato\u2019s late dialogues; he argues for the importance of Diogenes of Appolonia in particular, and he reconstructs a possible new fragment of Diogenes from the Timaeus and from the Hippocratic treatise On Breaths. In the Timaeus and other late dialogues Plato attempts to do better than his predecessors by standards implicit in Socrates\u2019 critique of Anaxagoras in the Phaedo, but what Plato offers remains consciously provisional. Aristotle argues that the Timaeus remains liable to some of the same criticisms that Socrates had leveled against Anaxagoras, and Aristotle\u2019s own cosmology and theology take up Plato\u2019s challenge to carry out Anaxagoras\u2019 promise of an explanation of the world through Nous, and attempt to improve on the Timaeus asPlato had improved on Anaxagoras. In this way the Timaeus serves as an essential starting point, not onlyfor those later ancient philosophers who took it as an authoritative statement on the world and on God but also for those who took it as a challenge to do better.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Stephen Menn", "rating": "4.08", "pages": "104"}, {"id": 2213202, "title": "Surrender to the Highlander", "blurb": "Torn between honor and desire...Innocent Margriet Gunnarsdottir carried a heavy secret.

In it, he proposes that the stability and integrity of humans depend on the preservation of the balance of natural systems surrounding the individual--family, community, society, ecosystem, and the ecosphere itself. Portraying life processes and ecological thinking as holistic, Goldsmith calls for a paradigm shift away from the reductionist approach of modern science.The basic belief in the whole was at the heart of the worldview of primal, earth-oriented societies, as manifested by the Tao of the ancient Chinese, the R'ta of Vedic India, the Asha of the Avestas, and the Sedaq of the tribal Hebrews. The Way was the path taken to maintain the critical order of the cosmos. Echoing the way of traditional cultures, Goldsmith presents an all-embracing, coherent worldview that promotes more harmonious and sustainable practices capable of satisfying real biological, social, ecological, and spiritual needs.Revised to include a glossary, index, bibliographic notes, and several updated chapters, this is a major work by one of our boldest and most promising thinkers.\n...more", "genre": ["Environment", "Sustainability", "Environment", "Nonfiction", "Biology", "Ecology"], "author": "Edward Goldsmith", "rating": "4.15", "pages": "352"}, {"id": 2213990, "title": "Doctor Who and Warriors' Gate", "blurb": "The Doctor and his companions are trapped in an E-Space universe, struggling to find the co-ordinates which will break the deadlock and take them back into Normal Space.When all else fails, the Doctor suggests programming the TARDIS on the toss of a coin.

His examples range throughout the rich and heterogeneous tapestry of the earth's surface: the dramatic variations of mountainous topography, the undulating ground and crevices of level limestone karst, and the subtle realm of sand dunes. He describes the ongoing evolutionary consequences of the geology-plant interface and the often underestimated role of geology in shaping climate.Kruckeberg explores the fundamental connection between plants and geology, including the historical roots of geobotany, the reciprocal relations between geology and other environmental influences, geomorphology and its connection with plant life, lithology as a potent selective agent for plants, and the physical and biological influences of soils. Special emphasis is given to the responses of plants to exceptional rock types and their soils--serpentines, limestones, and other azonal (exceptional) substrates. Edaphic ecology, especially of serpentines, has been his specialty for years.Kruckeberg's research fills a significant gap in the field of environmental science by connecting the conventionally separated disciplines of the physical and biological sciences. Geology and Plant Life is the result of more than forty years of research into the question of why certain plants grow on certain soils and certain terrain structures, and what happens when this relationship is disrupted by human agents. It will be useful to a wide spectrum of professionals in the natural sciences: plant ecologists, paleobiologists, climatologists, soil scientists, geologists, geographers, and conservation scientists, as well as serious amateurs in natural history.\n...more", "genre": ["Science", "Geology"], "author": "Arthur R.

Qui etait Georges Palante ? Peu de gens se souviennent de ce philosophe si particulier, et rares sont ceux qui le lisent encore, bien que ses oeuvres completes soient en voie de reedition, pour fevrier 2002, aux editions Alive. Pourtant, Palante (1862 - 1925) etait un personnage essentiel du paysage philosophique de ce debut de siecle. Louis Guilloux en avait meme fait le modele de son heros dans Cripure (c'est-a-dire: critique de la raison pure ). Nietzscheen, engage a gauche, aristocratique et libertaire, theoricien de L'Ariste (concept resumant son ideal aristocratique et artiste), Palante enseigna la philosophie et eut une existence assez miserable (alcool, drogue, mauvaises frequentation...) qui le mena a un suicide tragique. Pour Michel Onfray la figure de ce philosophe est donc, en quelque sorte, inaugurale. C'est la, dans son oeuvre, qu'il a puise les concepts et la vision d'un monde dont il n'a cesse depuis d'explorer les themes (hedonisme, anarchisme, primaute du corps). Son essai est, a la fois, une biographie, un commentaire et un prolongement de l'oeuvre de Palante: il est ecrit dans une langue pure et sensible.

But what makes it so unlikely to be confused with any other book of history, politics, or culture--with, in fact, any other book--is its unashamed depth of feeling: think The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire crossed with Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. West visited Yugoslavia for the first time in 1936. What she saw there affected her so much that she had to return--partly, she writes, because it most resembled the country I have always seen between sleeping and waking, and partly because it was like picking up a strand of wool that would lead me out of a labyrinth in which, to my surprise, I had found myself immured. Black Lamb is the chronicle of her travels, but above all it is West following that strand of wool: through countless historical digressions; through winding narratives of battles, slavery, and assassinations; through Shakespeare and Augustine and into the very heart of human frailty.  West wrote on the brink of World War II, when she was already convinced of the inevitability of the second Anglo-German war. The resulting book is colored by that impending conflict, and by West's search for universals amid the complex particulars of Balkan history. In the end, she saw the region's doom--and our own--in a double infatuation with sacrifice, the black lamb and grey falcon of her title.

This study examines the ways in which Mexican and Native women challenged the patriarchal traditional culture of the Spanish, Mexican, and early American eras in California, tracing the shifting contingencies surrounding their lives from the imposition of Spanish Catholic colonial rule in the 1770s to the ascendancy of Euro-American Protestant capitalist society in the 1880s. Negotiating Conquest begins with an examination of how gender and ethnicity shaped the policies and practices of the Spanish conquest, showing that Hispanic women, marriage, and the family played a central role in producing a stable society on Mexico\u2019s northernmost frontier. It then examines how gender, law, property, and ethnicity shaped social and class relations among Mexicans and native peoples, focusing particularly on how women dealt with the gender-, class-, and ethnic-based hierarchies that gave Mexican men patriarchal authority. With the American takeover in 1846, the text\u2019s focus shifts to how the imposition of foreign legal, economic, linguistic, and cultural norms affected the status of Mexican women, male-female relations, and the family. Addressing such issues as divorce, legitimacy, and inheritance, it describes the manner in which the conquest weakened the economic position of both Mexican women and men while at the same time increasing the leverage of Mexican women in their personal and social relationships with men. Drawing on archival materials\u2014including dozens of legal cases\u2014that have been largely ignored by other scholars, Ch\u00e1vez-Garc\u00eda examines federal, state, and municipal laws across many periods in order to reveal how women used changing laws, institutions, and norms governing property, marriage and sexuality, and family relations to assert and protect their rights. By showing that mexicanas contested the limits of male rule and insisted that patriarchal relationships be based on reciprocity, Negotiating Conquest expands our knowledge of how patriarchy functioned and evolved as it reveals the ways in which conquest can transform social relationships in both family and community.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Feminism", "History"], "author": "Miroslava Ch\u00e1vez-Garc\u00eda", "rating": "3.57", "pages": "241"}, {"id": 2217229, "title": "Obras Completas 1", "blurb": "Este volumen contiene:1923 Fervor de Buenos Aires1925 Luna de Enfrente1929 Cuaderno San Mart\u00edn1930 Evaristo Carriego1932 Discusi\u00f3n1935 Historia Universal de la Infamia1936 Historia de la Eternidad1944 Ficciones1949 El Aleph", "genre": ["Poetry", "Fiction", "Spanish Literature", "Short Stories", "Classics", "Literature"], "author": "Jorge Luis Borges", "rating": "4.67", "pages": "679"}, {"id": 2217277, "title": "The Kids Book of Canada's Railway: And How the CPR Was Built", "blurb": "November 7, 1885, marked the completion of one of the longest, most expensive, most challenging engineering feats in the world -- the Canadian Pacific Railway.

After her mother died, vivacious Katey Tyler fled her dull Connecticut town, hoping to meet her relatives in England and find adventure and romance on a grand tour of Europe. She had no idea that her life-changing travels would have both in spades -- as well as danger and intrigue -- when she catches the eye of ship owner Boyd Anderson and inadvertently stumbles upon a high-stakes kidnapping.When Sir Anthony Malory's young daughter is abducted from London's Hyde Park, her kidnapper mistakenly sends the ransom note to the home of Sir Anthony's brother, James. With James and his wife, Georgina, in the Caribbean, the demands are received by their houseguest -- Georgina's youngest brother, Boyd Anderson. Searching for the girl with Anthony, the notoriously hot-headed American sea captain fully intends to make the foolhardy villain pay. But he hardly expects to find exquisite Katey Tyler, recently a passenger on his ship, at the center of the plot!Little does Katey realize that in having caught the attention of Boyd Anderson -- and in meeting up with the Malorys -- she's about to experience more excitement than the typical young lady encounters on a grand tour, and her life will never be dull again.

Anyone interested in history, race relations, sociology, or the intellectual heritage of the United States will find this an essential read. American writer, civil rights activist, and scholar W.E.B. DUBOIS (1868-1963) was a free-born African American in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He was the first black man to receive a PhD from Harvard University and was convinced that education was the means for African Americans to achieve equality. He wrote a number of important books, including The Philadelphia Negro (1899), Black Folk, Then and Now (1899), and The Negro (1915).\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Classics", "Race", "Writing", "Essays", "Cultural", "African American", "Sociology", "Philosophy", "Politics", "Social Movements", "Social Justice"], "author": "W.E.B.

Dyson also uses this landmark anniversary as the starting point for a comprehensive reevaluation of the fate of Black America over the four decades that followed King\u2019s death. Dyson ambitiously investigates the ways in which African-Americans have in fact made it to the Promised Land of which King spoke, while shining a bright light on the ways in which the nation has faltered in the quest for racial justice. He also probes the virtues and flaws of charismatic black leadership that has followed in King\u2019s wake, from Jesse Jackson to Barack Obama.Always engaging and inspiring, April 4, 1968 celebrates the prophetic leadership of Dr. King, and challenges America to renew its commitment to his deeply moral vision.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Race", "Politics", "Biography", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Audiobook", "Cultural", "African American", "Sociology", "Social Movements", "Social Justice"], "author": "Michael Eric Dyson", "rating": "3.79", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 2219166, "title": "Mannequin", "blurb": "A St-Cyr and Kohler investigation set in Occupied Paris during World War II.

Set in alluring Shanghai at the turn of the century, The Binding Chair intertwines the destinies of a Chinese woman determined to forget her past and a Western girl focused on the promises of the future. Beautiful, charismatic, destructive, May escapes an ar-ranged marriage in rural nineteenth-century China for life in a Shanghai brothel, where she meets Arthur, an Australian whose philanthropic pursuits lead him into one scrape after another. As a member of the Foot Emancipation Society, Arthur calls on May not for his pleasure but for her rehabilitation, only to find himself immediately and helplessly seduced by the sight of her bound feet. Reforming May is out of the question, so love-struck Arthur marries her instead and brings her home to live with him, his sister and brother-in-law, and their two girls, Alice and Cecily. In Alice, May sees the possibility of redemption: a surrogate for a child she has lost. And it is to May that Alice turns for the love her own mother withholds. But when the twelve-year-old is caught preparing her aunt's opium pipe, she is shipped off to a London boarding school, far from the dangerous influence of the woman who will come to reclaim her and to control the whole family. The Binding Chair unfolds among scenes of astonishing beauty and cruelty, in a lawless place where traditions and cultures clash, and where tragedy threatens a world built on the banks of unsettled waters--from the bustling Whangpoo River to the lake of blood in the Chinese afterworld. By turns shocking, exquisite, and hilarious, The Binding Chair is another spellbinding literary triumph by the writer whose work Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times has called powerful and hypnotic.

Mrs Fordham explains her reason for attempting the work. She wrote: 'Most people have heard of the late C. G. Jung, often linking him vaguely with Sigmund Freud; and although the terms 'complex', 'introvert', and 'extravert' are often used in everyday speech, few realise they were coined by him. Jung\u2019s influence has been far-reaching, touching many of the human sciences, and his ideas have proved of value in such widely differing fields as biology and theology.

Challenging conventional views of Moscow's foreign policy, Andrei Tsygankov takes a constructivist approach to argue that definitions of national interest depend on visions of national identity and that national identity is rooted both in history and domestic politics. Yet the author also highlights the role of the external environment in affecting the balance of power among competing domestic groups. Drawing on an impressive mastery of both Russian and Western sources, Andrei P. Tsygankov shows how Moscow's policies have shifted under different leaders' visions of Russia's national interests. He gives an overview of the ideas and pressures that motivated Russian foreign policy in four different periods: the Gorbachev era of the late 1980s, the liberal 'Westernizers' era under Kozyrev in the early 1990s, the relatively hardline statist policy under Primakov, and the more pragmatic statist policy under Putin. Evaluating the successes and failures of Russia's foreign policies, Tsygankov explains its many turns as Russia's identity and interaction with the West have evolved.

From his early childhood \nLogan Gonzago Mountstuart, writer, was born in 1906, and died of a heart attack on October 5, 1991, aged 85. William Boyd's novel Any Human Heart is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling my personal rollercoaster--or rather, not so much a rollercoaster, but a yo-yo, a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child. From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism, and abject poverty.Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall Any Human Heart is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. --Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Historical", "Literary Fiction", "Novels", "Classics", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Contemporary", "Literature", "Audiobook"], "author": "William  Boyd", "rating": "4.28", "pages": "480"}, {"id": 2231841, "title": "Blessed - The Autobiography", "blurb": "George Best needs little introduction.

But Best was unable to cope with the success and fame his football genius brought. His fabled story is littered with tales of women and sex and, of course, alcohol.

Much of Japan's modern history has been erased from postwar textbooks, and a whole generation has grown up knowing nothing of the Rape of Nanking, Pearl Harbor, the Second World War death camps, and countless other atrocities. All that remains are Hiroshima and Nagasaki, symbols of Japan's eternal innocence. Sterling and Peggy Seagrave correct these falsehoods and expose the collusion and corruption that have been at the heart of the postwar Japanese economic miracle. And far from being a symbolic reminder of an ancient past, as the Japanese royal family is sometimes portrayed, the authors point out that it has been at the epicenter of venality and cruelty. Prince Chichibu, Emperor Hirohito's brother, turns out to have masterminded Golden Lily, the systematic looting of every country Japan occupied in the prewar years. Prince Yasuhiko was the brains behind the Rape of Nanking. And dear old Hirohito was so hands-on during the war that he could have halted Pearl Harbor. Moreover, the royal family was so comfortably in bed with the zaibatsu, the corporate ruling elite, that it made a fortune out of the war while the rest of the nation starved. That none of this has come out before is only partly due to Japanese revisionism. We, too, have to share the blame.

Hecht's coverage of classical physics is clear and insightful. He shows students how 21st-century physics illuminates the classical topics of each chapter, adding excitement to the subject matter. Over 1,300 illustrations make it possible for students to visualize a diversity of physical phenomena. Many of these are multi-frame, sequential drawings allowing students to comprehend the temporal unfolding of complex events. A selection of sketch art teaches students how to create problem-solving diagrams. This new edition of the text was designed to aggressively address the issue of problem solving for students (guided by contemporary physics education research). To this end Hecht has provided not only his approach to the five-step problem-solving framework but also a wide range of new problems and solutions specifically designed to build student capability and confidence.\n...more", "genre": ["Science", "Science", "Physics"], "author": "Eugene Hecht", "rating": "4.45", "pages": "1200"}, {"id": 2233230, "title": "Quest For Meaning: Philosophy Made Easy For Filipinos", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Florentino T.

Hess trace three decades of struggle and change wrought by the New Feminist Movement. Contemporary feminism has indelibly and irrevocably transformed American culture, institutional structures and practices, and the consciousness of individual women and men. Whether or not openly acknowledged, a majority of American women support the goals of this most broad-based and far-reaching social movement. The authors trace the rise of contemporary feminism, noting its ties to the earlier suffrage movement, its grounding in historical changes since the 1920s, and the particular conditions of its emergence in the 1960s. Ferree and Hess describe the diversity of its multiple constituencies and ideological positions, tracing numerous areas of conflict as well as consolidation, as both the movement and its external environment change over the decades. Internal dissension and encounters with a powerful backlash movement have shaped the new feminism in directions only dimly envisaged in the 1960s, yet of profound significance for the future. In the light of these developments, each chapter has been reconceptualized and rewritten, and two new ones added to cover the period from 1982 to the present. The volume closes with an assessment of the achievements of the New Feminist Movement, its strengths and failures, and the potential for further changes in the new millennium. Complementing the book's eight chapters are photographs and tables, as well as a selected bibliography and a new feature - a chronology of major events in the history of American feminism over the past three decades.

Under the guise of defending an ideal of \u201ctrue womanhood,\u201d these powerful women sought to keep the vote from lower-class women, fearing it would result in an increase in the \u201cignorant vote\u201d and in their own displacement from positions of influence.

Dit boek over de relatie tussen het sultanaat Djambi (zuid-sumatra) en het Indische gouvernement (Batavia) met op de achtergrond nog het Ministerie van Kolonien in Den Haag kiest daarin een eigen positie. De periode van circa een eeuw (1830-1907, gevolgd door een epiloog tot 1949), die wordt bestreken, verschaft een dwarsdoorsnede van de geschiedenis van het Nederlands kolonialisme, waarin de afzonderlijke lagen met hun verschillende kleuring zichtbaar worden. Op deze wijze komen zeer uiteenlopende aspecten aan bod: politieke misverstanden rond 1830, buitenlandse bemoeienis met de regio, een Amerikaanse avonturier en de rol van politieke rituelen. Deze vormen tezamen met de lange tijd succesrijke overlevingsstrategieen van een onbereikbare sultan, oliebelangen, oorlog en een guerrilla de bouwstenen van het verhaal. In een slothoofdstuk vergelijkt de auteur het Nederlandse optreden in Djambi met andere expedities, die rond 1900 de koloniale staat tot een eenheid smeedden.

Para eso, el due\u00f1o de la botella debe cumplir una serie de requisitos: debe vender la botella a otra persona antes de morir o ir\u00e1 al infierno, el precio de venta deber\u00e1 ser menor al que se obtuvo y el nuevo due\u00f1o debe ser consciente de este requisito. Keawe compra la botella y desea ser el due\u00f1o de una gran mansi\u00f3n en Haw\u00e1i. El deseo se cumple: su t\u00edo y su primo fallecen en un accidente y \u00e9l hereda una gran fortuna, con la cual puede construirse su nueva casa. Tras haber visto cumplir su sue\u00f1o, Keawe vende la botella a un amigo y vive feliz en la que \u00e9l llama la casa luminosa. Se casa con una bell\u00edsima mujer llamada Kokua y resulta que Keawe se enferma de lepra y por eso deber\u00eda renunciar, no s\u00f3lo a su mujer, si no a la casa para ir a vivir a una colonia de leprosos. Para evitar tal pesadilla, el hawaiano busca la botella de nuevo y descubre que ahora solo cuesta dos centavos: si la compra es posible que se convierta en el \u00faltimo due\u00f1o y, por tanto, vaya al infierno. Asumiendo esto, decide comprarla, puesto que con una mujer as\u00ed vale la pena ir al infierno. La mujer, al darse cuenta de la situaci\u00f3n de su marido, propone una soluci\u00f3n: viajar a Tahit\u00ed, donde cuatro c\u00e9ntimos son poco menos que un centavo, y vender all\u00ed la botella pero, a su llegada, descubren que los supersticiosos habitantes del lugar reh\u00fasan comprar tal cosa.", "genre": ["Classics", "Short Stories", "Fiction", "Horror", "Fantasy", "19th Century", "School"], "author": "Robert Louis Stevenson", "rating": "3.71", "pages": "77"}, {"id": 2235308, "title": "Happy Birthday, Jamela!", "blurb": "What Jamela wants for her birthday is a pair of beautiful princess shoes.

In this compelling work of character-driven history, Jeffrey Rosen recounts the history of the Court through the personal and philosophical rivalries on the bench that transformed the law-and by extension, our lives. The story begins with the great Chief Justice John Marshall and President Thomas Jefferson, cousins from the Virginia elite whose differing visions of America set the tone for the Court's first hundred years. The tale continues after the Civil War with Justices John Marshall Harlan and Oliver Wendell Holmes, who clashed over the limits of majority rule. Rosen then examines the Warren Court era through the lens of the liberal icons Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, for whom personality loomed larger than ideology. He concludes with a pairing from our own era, the conservatives William H. Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, only one of whom was able to build majorities in support of his views. Through these four rivalries, Rosen brings to life the perennial conflict that has animated the Court-between those justices guided by strong ideology and those who forge coalitions and adjust to new realities. He illuminates the relationship between judicial temperament and judicial success or failure. The stakes are nothing less than the future of American jurisprudence.", "genre": ["History", "Law", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "American History", "Biography", "Unfinished"], "author": "Jeffrey Rosen", "rating": "3.66", "pages": "Audio"}, {"id": 2235436, "title": "Occasions of Poetry", "blurb": "For me the act of writing is an exploration, a reaching out, an act of trusting search for the correct incantation that will return me certain feelings whenever I want them.

Jace returns to Lenny Lowell's office only to find the cops there, the lawyer dead, and Jace himself considered the prime suspect in the savage murder.

Parker is on the downhill slide of a once-promising career, and he doesn't want to be reminded that he used to be one of the hotshots, working cases that made instant celebrities of everyone involved. Like the case of fading retty-boy actor Rob Cole, accused of the brutal murder of his wife, Tricia Crowne-Cole, daughter of one of the most powerful men in the city, L.A.'s latest crime of the century.Robbery/Homicide has no reason to be looking at a dead small-time scumbag lawyer or chasing a bike messenger...unless there's something in it for them. Maybe Lenny Lowell had a connection to something big enough to be killed for. Parker begins a search for answers that will lead him to a killer\u2014or the end of his career.

Ronald Bayer presents a political analysis of the psychiatric battle involved, from the first confrontations organized by gay demonstrators at psychiatric conventions to the referendum initiated by orthodox psychiatrists. The result is a fascinating view of the individuals who led the debate and the fundamental questions that engaged them: social and cultural values, the definition of disease, and the nature of sexuality.

The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.", "genre": ["Classics", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Childrens", "Young Adult", "Adventure", "Literature"], "author": "Jane Carruth", "rating": "4.03", "pages": "92"}, {"id": 2237984, "title": "Fighting for Canada: Seven Battles, 1758-1945", "blurb": "It is a myth that Canadians are an unmilitary people.

Grant is a mystery to me,\u00a0\u00a0said Sherman, and I believe he is a mystery to himself.\u00a0\u00a0Geoffrey Perret's account offers new insights into Grant the commander and Grant the president that would have astonished both his friends, such as Sherman, and his enemies.Based on extensive research, including material either not seen or not used by other writers, this biography explains for the first time how Grant's military genius ultimately triumphed as he created a new approach to battle. He was, says Perret, the man who taught the army how to fight. As president, Grant was widely misunderstood and underrated. That was mainly because he was, as Perret shows, the first modern president--the first man to preside over a rich, industrialized America that had put slavery behind it and was struggling to provide racial justice for all.Grant's story--from a frontier boyhood to West Point; from heroic feats in the Mexican War to grinding poverty in St. Louis; from his return to the army and eventual election to the presidency; from his two-year journey around the world to his final battle to finish his Personal Memoirs--is one of the most adventurous and moving in American history.What distinguishes this narrative are Perret's bristling style and his skillful blend of tactical analysis and conventional biography. . . .

Animal-loving children have been devoted to Black Beauty throughout this century, and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness. Black Beauty tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails--in a gentle, 19th-century way--against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships, and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all.

In 1868, in the Les Ayzies rock shelter called Abri de Cro-Magnon (Cro-Magnon meaning big hole in the local patois), the first skeletons of our direct ancestors were discovered. The shelter, now scoured of its holdings, can still be visited; it is part of the rockwall that undulates as the spinal backdrop of Les Eylzies; one section of the wall serves as the back wall of Hotel Cro-Magnon. The hotel can thus be thought of as the social outgrowth of our discovery of who we are. The poetics of Hotel Cro-Magnon are based on the belief that there is an archetypal poem, and that its most ancient design is probably the labyrinth. The first words of a poem, from this viewpoint, propose and nose toward a confrontation with what the writer is only partially aware of, or may not be prepared to address until it emerges, flushed forth by meanders and dead-ends. Poetry twists toward the unknown and seeks to realize something beyond the poet's initial awareness.\n...more", "genre": ["Poetry"], "author": "Clayton Eshleman", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "180"}, {"id": 2239600, "title": "Ajax Security", "blurb": "The Hands-On, Practical Guide to Preventing Ajax-Related Security Vulnerabilities    More and more Web sites are being rewritten as Ajax applications; even traditional desktop software is rapidly moving to the Web via Ajax. But, all too often, this transition is being made with reckless disregard for security. If Ajax applications aren't designed and coded properly, they can be susceptible to far more dangerous security vulnerabilities than conventional Web or desktop software. Ajax developers desperately need guidance on securing their applications: knowledge that's been virtually impossible to find, until now. Ajax Security systematically debunks today's most dangerous myths about Ajax security, illustrating key points with detailed case studies of actual exploited Ajax vulnerabilities, ranging from MySpace's Samy worm to MacWorld's conference code validator. Even more important, it delivers specific, up-to-the-minute recommendations for securing Ajax applications in each major Web programming language and environment, including .NET, Java, PHP, and even Ruby on Rails. You'll learn how to: - Mitigate unique risks associated with Ajax, including overly granular Web services, application control flow tampering, and manipulation of program logic - Write new Ajax code more safely--and identify and fix flaws in existing code - Prevent emerging Ajax-specific attacks, including JavaScript hijacking and persistent storage theft - Avoid attacks based on XSS and SQL Injection--including a dangerous SQL Injection variant that can extract an entire backend database with just two requests - Leverage security built into Ajax frameworks like Prototype, Dojo, and ASP.NET AJAX Extensions--and recognize what you still must implement on your own - Create more secure mashup applications Ajax Security will be an indispensable resource for developers coding or maintaining Ajax applications; architects and development managers planning or designing new Ajax software, and all software security professionals, from QA specialists to penetration testers.", "genre": ["Technology"], "author": "Billy Hoffman", "rating": "3.68", "pages": "470"}, {"id": 2239622, "title": "\u062a\u0639\u0637\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062d\u0634\u062a\u200c\u0632\u0627", "blurb": "\u062a\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u06cc\u06a9 \u067e\u0633\u0631\u06a9 \u067e\u0646\u062c \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0647\u200c\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u067e\u062f\u0631\u0634 \u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u0633\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u200c\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u200c\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0634 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627\u064b \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0634 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u063a\u0631\u06cc\u0628\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0648 \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u061b\u061b ... \u0648 \u062a\u0648\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u0648\u0686\u0648\u0644\u0648 \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0634\u0628 \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f. \u0686\u0647 \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631\u06cc!

The first edition credited the work's protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents.Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is presented as an autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer), a castaway who spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers, before ultimately being rescued. The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called M\u00e1s a Tierra, now part of Chile, which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966.Despite its simple narrative style, Robinson Crusoe was well received in the literary world and is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. It is generally seen as a contender for the first English novel. Before the end of 1719, the book had already run through four editions, and it has gone on to become one of the most widely published books in history, spawning so many imitations, not only in literature but also in film, television and radio, that its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade.", "genre": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Adventure", "Literature", "Historical Fiction", "Novels", "18th Century"], "author": "Daniel Defoe", "rating": "3.68", "pages": "Audio"}, {"id": 2243290, "title": "Typhon's Children", "blurb": "To the new colonists, the teeming, ocean-dominated planet of Typhon seems a wondrous and exotic paradise--until the land erupts with incomprehensible violence, consuming the colony in a fiery hell.

Isolated and bored, Effi finds comfort and distraction in a brief liaison with Major Crampas, a married man with a dangerous reputation. But years later, when Effi has almost forgotten her affair, the secret returns to haunt her - with fatal consequences. In taut, ironic prose Fontane depicts a world where sexuality and the will to enjoy life are stifled by vain pretences of civilization, and the obligations of circumstance. Considered to be his greatest novel, this is a humane, unsentimental portrait of a young woman torn between her duties as a wife and mother and the instincts of her heart.Hugh Rorrison's clear, modern translation is accompanied by an introduction by Helen Chambers, which compares Effi with other literary heroines such as Emma Bovary and Anna Karenina.Theodor Fontane (1819-98) was a German novelist and potitical reporter. Along with Effi Briest, Fontane is remembered for Frau Jenny Treibel (1892), an ironic criticism of middle-class hypocrisy and small-mindedness.If you enjoyed Effi Briest you may like Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, also available in Penguin Classics.'I have been haunted by it ... as I am by those novels that seem to do more than they say, to induce strong emotions that can't quite be accounted for' Hermione Lee, Sunday Times", "genre": ["Classics", "German Literature", "Fiction", "Germany", "School", "19th Century", "Literature"], "author": "Theodor Fontane", "rating": "3.27", "pages": "346"}, {"id": 2244304, "title": "Jacques Brel, Une Vie", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Music", "Biography", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Olivier Todd", "rating": "3.52", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 2244424, "title": "The House of Sleep", "blurb": "Like a surreal and highly caffeinated version of The Big Chill, Jonathan Coe's new novel follows four students who knew each other in college in the eighties.

The shame of destruction cannot be erased. Trust in the world, which already collapsed in part at the first blow, but in the end, under torture, fully, will not be regained. That one's fellow man was experienced as the antiman remains in the tortured person as accumulated horror. It blocks the view into a world in which the principle of hope rules.

Any thought that he was destined to become one of the best-known authors of his age would have been as fantastic as the past 37 years of his life. But in both cases the improbable came about. Becoming Curate of Olney, Bucks, in 1764, Newton there laid his reputation as an evangelical writer, pre-eminently by his published Letters and by the Olney Hymns (including, 'How sweet the name of Jesus sounds', 'Glorious things of thee are spoken', and 'Amazing Grace'). Before the end of his subsequent pastorate at St. Mary, Woolnoth, London (1780-1807), his writings were prized around the world from America to Australia. The 19th century saw a number of rival editions of his Complete Works, but it is the edition from which the present is reprinted (which includes his Letters to a Wife) which has the best claim to that title.Newton has a firm place in the classics of Christian literature. While his style is strong and clear, it is the spiritual attractiveness and importance of of his main themes which secure the permanent value of his writings. Most of his books came, unpremeditated, out of a need to help his congregation or individual hearers, and it is in practical helpfulness towards Christian living that he excels. If he is loved rather than admired, it is for this reason. Conformity to Christ is the one subject upon which all his themes finally focus ('It will not be a burden to me at the hour of death that I have thought too highly of Jesus, expected too much from Him myself, or laboured too much in commending and setting Him forth to others'). Not surprisingly, Alexander Whyte could write: 'For myself, I keep John Newton on my selectest shelf of spiritual books: by far the best kind of books in the whole world of books'.\n...more", "genre": ["Christian", "Religion", "Theology", "Biography"], "author": "John Newton", "rating": "4.56", "pages": "704"}, {"id": 2244655, "title": "Black Veil: A Memoir with Digressions", "blurb": "In his early 20s, a lifetime of excess left Rick Moody suddenly stranded in a depression so profound that he feared for his life.

As a 23-year-old bank clerk, Eastman bought his first camera and began simplifying the cumbersome and messy wet-plate process. With only two years' experience, he patented a dry-plate coating machine and began selling photographic plates. Soon, the business was doing so well that he quit his job at the bank and started his own company.Eastman's success was based in part on his own inventions, but even more on his ability to raise capital, recruit technically skilled employees, sell his own products, and outmaneuver his competitors. In this revealing and informative new biography, Brayer shows us how such key innovations as roll film and the light, hand-held camera helped the Eastman Kodak Company dominate the world market.More importantly, Brayer draws a vivid portrait of the man behind the money. Eastman worked hard at keeping out of the limelight and even insisted that his donations be kept anonymous, prompting the Boston Globe to call him America's most modest and least- known millionaire. His aggressive business personality was a sharp contrast to his personal life: Eastman once joked that it was his goal to take two six-month vacations in a year. He would regularly forsake the office to bicycle around Europe or ride a stagecoach through the snowy trails of Yellowstone Park. He was an art lover, who once bartered 60 shares of Kodak stock in the 1890s for a painting he felt he must have, and a classical music enthusiast, who built a school for the training of virtuosos.Despite his retirement in 1925, Eastman showed little sign of slowing down. Making moneyhad been interesting, but putting money to work became more so. In the 1920s he designed a special camera for use in orthodontia and established elaborate dental clinics for needy children in Rochester, London, Paris, Brussels, Stockholm, and Rome. He oversaw the building of the Eastman Theatre and the Eastman School of Music. His contributions built a new campus for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a new medical school for the University of Rochester. Finally, he became the largest contributor to the education of African Americans during the 1920s and the Tuskeegee Institute's most important benefactor.\n...more", "genre": ["Biography", "History", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Elizabeth Brayer", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "688"}, {"id": 2245816, "title": "False Pretences", "blurb": "When a stranger is welcomed into a small British country town, she brings many of the community's long-buried secrets to the surface.

First, it reveals the extraordinary and innovative efforts now being made by companies and organizations - and by individuals - to solve problems and save lives both 'down the street and around the world'. Then it urges us to seek out what each of us, 'regardless of income, available time, age, and skills', can do to help, to give people a chance to live out their dreams.Bill Clinton shares his own experiences and those of other givers, representing a global flood tide of nongovernmental, nonprofit activity. These remarkable stories demonstrate that gifts of time, skills, things, and ideas are as important and effective as contributions of money. From Bill and Melinda Gates to a six-year-old California girl named McKenzie Steiner, who organized and supervised drives to clean up the beach in her community, Clinton introduces us to both well-known and unknown heroes of giving. Among them:Dr. Paul Farmer, who grew up living in the family bus in a trailer park, vowed to devote his life to giving high-quality medical care to the poor and has built innovative public health-care clinics first in Haiti and then in Rwanda; a New York couple, in Africa for a wedding, who visited several schools in Zimbabwe and were appalled by the absence of textbooks and school supplies. They founded their own organization to gather and ship materials to thirty-five schools. After three years, the percentage of seventh-graders who pass reading tests increased from 5 percent to 60 percent; Oseola McCarty, who after seventy-five years of eking out a living by washing and ironing, gave $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi to endow a scholarship fund for African-American students; Andre Agassi, who has created a college preparatory academy in the Las Vegas neighbourhood with the city's highest percentage of at-risk kids. 'Tennis was a stepping-stone for me,' says Agassi. 'Changing a child's life is what I always wanted to do'; Heifer International, which gave twelve goats to a Ugandan village. Within a year, Beatrice Biira's mother had earned enough money selling goat's milk to pay Beatrice's school fees and eventually to send all her children to school - and, as required, to pass on a baby goat to another family, thus multiplying the impact of the gift.Clinton speaks about men and women who traded in their corporate careers, and the fulfilment they now experience through giving. He speaks about energy-efficient practices, about progressive companies going green, about promoting fair wages and decent working conditions around the world. He shows us how one of the most important ways of giving can be an effort to change, improve, or protect a government policy. He outlines what we as individuals can do, the steps we can take, how much we should consider giving, and why our giving is so important.Bill Clinton's own actions in his post-presidential years have had an enormous impact on the lives of millions. Through his foundation and his work in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, he has become an international spokesperson and model for the power of giving.'We all have the capacity to do great things,' President Clinton says. 'My hope is that the people and stories in this book will lift spirits, touch hearts, and demonstrate that citizen activism and service can be a powerful agent of change in the world.'\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Politics", "Audiobook", "Inspirational", "Leadership", "Social Movements", "Social Justice", "Biography", "Business", "Education", "Philosophy"], "author": "Bill Clinton", "rating": "3.46", "pages": null}, {"id": 2245986, "title": "Wunschbringer", "blurb": "Der junge Vagabund Simon schwebt im siebten Himmel.

This new 3rd edition has been completely revised and updated to cover the many developments that have occurred since publication of the second edition in 1988, among the most notable of which is the entry into force in 1994 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Written so as to be intelligible to all concerned with maritime affairs, the book has proved particularly valuable to international lawyers and those taking specialist courses in the law of the sea and maritime studies. The aim of the third edition of this book remains broadly the same as that of the first two editions, namely to provide an introduction to the law of the sea, surveying not only the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea but also the customary and conventional law which supplements it. Since the previous edition of this book was published in 1988, much has happened in the law of the sea. Most notably, the 1982 Convention has entered into force and is now widely ratified. In addition a number of important multilateral treaties have been concluded (including the two Agreements of 1994 and 1995 relating to the implementation of the Convention), there have been several judgments by international courts and tribunals, and there has been a vast amount of bilateral treaty-making, national legislation and other forms of State practice. This new edition has been completely revised and extensively rewritten, although the basic structure of the book remains unchanged. Scope Of The Book: This book is concerned with the public international law of the sea - that is to say, with the rules and principles that bind States in their international relations concerning maritime matters. Accordingly, it does not discuss, except incidentally, the rules of private maritime law, which concern such matters as marine insurance, carriage of goods by sea and maritime liens; nor does it provide a survey of the municipal law of the United Kingdom, or of any other country, relating to the law of the sea. Furthermore, it is concerned with the laws of peace and not with the matters that have traditionally been considered under the heading of the laws of war, and consequently topics such as maritime neutrality and prize law fall beyond its scope. Nonetheless, this leaves a considerable body of law within the purview of the book. The treatment of the subject falls into two broad divisions. First, we take each of the major maritime zones recognized in contemporary international law, and explain the rules presently applicable to that zone against the background of the main stages of the historical development of those rules. Increasingly, however, the law of the sea is being developed along functional, rather than zonal, lines. For example, whereas the 1958 United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea concentrated mainly on producing a framework of rules governing States' rights and duties in the territorial sea, continental shelf and high seas, many of the more recent international agreements have been concerned not with particular zones but with particular uses of the seas, such as pollution, fishing (which was in fact also the subject of one of the conventions produced by the 1958 conference) and navigation. We have, therefore, thought it necessary, in order to bring together the many rules of international law relating to the various uses of the seas, to provide separate surveys of each of the main activities carried out in the seas. These functional surveys appear in the later chapters of the book.\n...more", "genre": ["Law"], "author": "R.R.

But the meaning and depth of that mark has been obscured. A major theme of this important study is that McCarthy did not suppress or stifle political thinking so much as he radically transformed it. A large block of American intellectuals evolved an original theory of politics in reaction to McCarthyism. The author states that, A loosely coherent social theory, substantially concerned with comprehending McCarthyism, emerged in the 1950's. My interest is in that social theory, as it explains McCarthy, as it reinterprets the reform tradition, as it refracts American history through the myopia of a traumatized intelligentsia.Many American intellectuals found McCarthy's roots in the agrarian radical tradition--emerging from Populists, La Follette progressives, the Non-Partisan League. During the McCarthy years, the term 'radical Right' began making its appearance in liberal circles. Liberal intellectuals became suspicious of popular movements; the mass of people, they felt, could not be trusted to support beneficial social policies. The populace seemed more preoccupied with suspicion of the educated, the cosmopolitan, the alien. Established political elites and institutions seemed to provide surer safeguards for constitutional values. In this connection, the author discusses the responses of such men as Richard Hofstadter, Seymour Martin Lipset, Daniel Bell, Edward Shils, Oscar Handling, Peter Viereck, and William Kornhauser.But the evidence, Rogin contends, does not support the view that McCarthyism grew from agrarian radical soil, and his study examines how McCarthyism was neither a radical movement outside of 'normal' American politics nor a cause that drew its strength from the mobilization of masses.The book concludes by suggesting that fear of popular uprisings and radical protest has divorced political analysis from the specific issues around which protest forms. These issues determine whether mass movements will be dangerous or valuable. Ignoring the issues of politics, Rogin argues, leads to a reliance on established institutions unhealthy and unrealistic in a free society.", "genre": ["Politics", "American History"], "author": "Michael Rogin", "rating": "3.90", "pages": "384"}, {"id": 2248956, "title": "Nathaniel Hawthorne's the Scarlet Letter", "blurb": "- Comprehensive reading and study guides for the world's most important literary masterpieces- A selection of critical excerpts provide a scholarly overview of each work- The Story Behind the Story places the work in a historical perspective and discusses it legacy- Each book includes a biographical sketch of the author, a descriptive list of characters, an extensive sum\n- Comprehensive reading and study guides for the world's most important literary masterpieces- A selection of critical excerpts provide a scholarly overview of each work- The Story Behind the Story places the work in a historical perspective and discusses it legacy- Each book includes a biographical sketch of the author, a descriptive list of characters, an extensive summary and analysis, and an annotated bibliography\n...more", "genre": ["Classics"], "author": "Harold Bloom", "rating": "3.63", "pages": null}, {"id": 2249026, "title": "Love Is Letting Go Of Fear", "blurb": "Experience the miracle of love in your life!\n In the #1 bestselling tradition of Marianne Williamson's A Return to Love, internationally renowned interpreter of A Course in Miracles, Jerry Jampolsky now offers an expanded audio presentation of his seminal bestseller, Love Is Letting Go Of Fear.

Florida governors have courted Klan ballots, and high-ranking lawmen collaborated with the Klan in campaigns of arson and murder.\u00a0In addition to recounting tales of violence, Newton addresses the critical question of how the hooded night riders continue to survive--a bitter, marginalized extremist movement that is still marching in what is arguably the Deep South\u2019s most progressive and ethnically diverse state. He also discusses how to curb guerrilla warfare before the Klan and its allies inaugurate a new century of terror.Michael Newton is a professional writer whose recent works include Racial and Religious Violence in America: A Chronology; The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers; and The Ku Klux Klan: An Encyclopedia, which received honorable mention awards from both the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Klanwatch project.

Glassie believes that all relevant historical evidence \u2013 unwritten as well as written \u2013 must be taken into account before historical truth can be found. He in convinced that any study of man\u2019s past must make use of nonverbal and verbal evidence, since written history \u2013 the story of man as recorded by the intellectual elite \u2013 does not tell us much about the everyday life, thoughts, and fears of the ordinary people of the past. Such people have always been in the majority, however, and a way has to be found to include them in any valid history. In Folk Housing in Middle Virginia Glassie admirably sets forth such a way.The people who lived in Middle Virginia in the eighteenth century are almost unknown to history because so little has been written about them. After Glassie selected the area \u2013 roughly Goochland and Louisa counties \u2013 for study, he selected a representative part of the countryside, recorded all the older houses there, developed a transformational grammar of traditional house designs, and examined the area\u2019s architectural stability and change. Comparing the houses with written accounts of the period, he found that the houses became more formal and lee related to their environment at the same time as the areas established political, economic, and religious institutions were disintegrating. It is as though the builders of the houses were deliberately trying to impose order on the surrounding chaotic world. Previous orthodox historical interpretations of the period have failed to note this. Glassie has provided new insights into the intellectual and social currents of the period, and at that time has rescued a heretofore little-known people from historiographical oblivion. Combining a fresh, perceptive approach with a broad interdisciplinary body of knowledge, ha has made an invaluable breakthrough in showing the way to understand the people of history who have left their material things as their only legacy.Henry Glassie is College Professor of Folklore at Indiana University. He is the author of Pattern in the Material Folk Culture of the Eastern United States, passing the Time in Ballymenone, Irish Folktales, and The Spirit of Folk Art.

The collection presents the most telling fiction and nonfiction produced in the South from the late eighteenth century to the present. Renowned authors such as James Agee, Richard Wright, Maya Angelou, Lee Smith, Eudora Welty, William Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor appear in these pages, but so do people whose writing did not immediately reach a large audience. For example, Harriet A. Jacobs' book Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, which is now recognized as one of the most illuminating narratives of a former slave, was neglected for generations. And Sarah Morgan's powerful Civil War Diary has only recently come to widespread attention. The Oxford Book of the American South presents compelling autobiographies, diaries, memoirs, and journalism as well as stories and selections from novels, and runs the spectrum from the conservative to the radical, the traditional to the innovative. Editors Edward L. Ayers and Bradley C. Mittendorf have arranged these diverse readings so that they fit together into a rich mosaic of Southern life and history. The sections of the book The Old South, The Civil War and Its Consequences, Hard Times, and The Turning unfold a vivid record of life below the Mason Dixon line. We see the antebellum period both from the perspective of those who experienced it first-hand, such as Thomas Jefferson and former slaves Olaudah Equiano and Frederick Douglass, and then from the perspective of authors looking back on that era, including William Styron and Sherley Anne Williams. Likewise, we see the Civil War through the eyes of witnesses such as Sam Watkins, through the eyes of later writers trying to make sense of the conflict, such as Robert Penn Warren, and through the eyes of those using the war's intense passions to fuel their fiction, such as Margaret Mitchell and Barry Hannah. The classic authors of the Southern Renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s appear here in the context of the hard times in which they wrote. The years since World War II are chronicled in the powerful words of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Letter from Birmingham Jail, George Garrett's Good bye, Good bye, Be Always Kind and True, and Peter Taylor's The Decline and Fall of the Episcopal Church, in the Year of Our Lord 1952. The editors have selected these readings, their Preface tells us, to convey the passions that have surfaced time and again in more than two hundred years of Southern writing. Indeed, the struggles, defeats, and triumphs chronicled inThe Oxford Book of the American South speak not just to the South, but to all of the American experience. They document and evoke some of the most dramatic episodes in the nation's life\n...more", "genre": ["History"], "author": "Edward L.

Tracking down terrorists in the Middle East. Interrogating enemy prisoners. Analyzing data from spy satellites and intercepted phone calls. All of these are vital intelligence tasks that traditionally have been performed by government officials accountable to Congress and the American people. But that is no longer the case.Starting during the Clinton administration, when intelligence budgets were cut drastically and privatization of government services became national policy, and expanding dramatically in the wake of 9/11, when the CIA and other agencies were frantically looking to hire analysts and linguists, the Intelligence Community has been relying more and more on corporations to perform sensitive tasks heretofore considered to be exclusively the work of federal employees. This outsourcing of intelligence activities is now a $50 billion-a-year business that consumes up to 70 percent of the U.S. intelligence budget. And it's a business that the government has tried hard to keep under wraps.Drawing on interviews with key players in the Intelligence-Industrial Complex, contractors' annual reports and public filings with the government, and on-the-spot reporting from intelligence industry conferences and investor briefings, Spies for Hire provides the first behind-the-scenes look at this new way of spying. Shorrock shows how corporations such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, SAIC, CACI International, and IBM have become full partners with the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the Pentagon in their most sensitive foreign and domestic operations. He explores how this partnership has led to wasteful spending and threatens to erode the privacy protections and congressional oversight so important to American democracy.Shorrock exposes the kinds of spy work the private sector is doing, such as interrogating prisoners in Iraq, managing covert operations, and collaborating with the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans' overseas phone calls and e-mails. And he casts light on a shadow Intelligence Community made up of former top intelligence officials who are now employed by companies that do this spy work, such as former CIA directors George Tenet and James Woolsey. Shorrock also traces the rise of Michael McConnell from his days as head of the NSA to being a top executive at Booz Allen Hamilton to returning to government as the nation's chief spymaster.From CIA covert actions to NSA eavesdropping, from Abu Ghraib to Guantanamo, from the Pentagon's techno-driven war in Iraq to the coming global battles over information dominance and control of cyberspace, contractors are doing it all. Spies for Hire goes behind today's headlines to highlight how private corporations are aiding the growth of a new and frightening national surveillance state.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Politics", "History", "Spy Thriller", "Espionage", "War", "War", "Military Fiction", "Audiobook", "Historical", "Reference"], "author": "Tim Shorrock", "rating": "3.65", "pages": "439"}, {"id": 2249446, "title": "Falling Free", "blurb": "Leo Graf was an effective engineer...Safety Regs weren't just the rule book he swore by; he'd helped write them.

Auf gut 1000 Seiten (zuz\u00fcglich 300 Seiten Anhang) schildert der britische Historiker den Aufstieg des Diktators zum Zenit der Macht und seinen j\u00e4hen Absturz bis zum bitteren Ende im Bunkerlabyrinth unter der Berliner Reichskanzlei. Nemesis lautet der Untertitel des englischen Originals -- nach der griechischen Racheg\u00f6ttin, die die Hybris von Krieg und Holocaust unbarmherzig verfolgt haben w\u00fcrde.

Somerset Maugham led many lives, including that of a doctor in London's slums, a successful playwright and novelist, an agent for British Intelligence during World War I, and a world traveler. In 1917, he took the first of many voyages to the Pacific Islands and the Far East, where his keen sense of observation found inspiration for some of his finest writing.Rain and Other South Sea Stories features one of Maugham's most famous tales, concerning the clash between a missionary and a prostitute. Rain was adapted for the stage and filmed on three separate occasions, its leading character portrayed by Gloria Swanson, Joan Crawford, and Rita Hayworth. This collection also includes Macintosh, a psychological study of the competition between two officials; The Fall of Edward Barnard, a tale of social rebellion that foreshadows The Razor's Edge; The Pool, a portrait of a marriage between people from different cultures; and other compelling stories of life in the tropics.\n...more", "genre": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Classics", "Literature", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Literature", "English Literature", "Adult", "Literature", "20th Century", "Audiobook"], "author": "W.

Unfortunately, much of it is scattered in books and journals that are not easily accessible. Under the editorship of Joe W. Trotter and Eric Ledell Smith, African Americans in Pennsylvania brings together an outstanding array of this scholarship and makes it accessible to a wider audience, including general as well as professional students of the black experience.This volume, co-published with the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, offers the most comprehensive history of the state's black history to date. Chapters emphasize the interplay of class and race from the origins of the Commonwealth during the seventeenth century, through the era of deindustrialization in the late twentieth century. We see not only poor and working-class people but also educated business and professional people. And although scholarship has traditionally focused on the experiences of black men, this volume includes significant research on black women. Most important, this volume suggests a conceptual framework for a historical synthesis of the state's African American experience.In his introduction, Trotter assesses the strengths and limitations of existing scholarship, showing how it is built on the contributions of nineteenth-century pioneers as well as those of the first generation of professional historians, including W. E. B. Du Bois, Richard R. Wright, and Edward Raymond Turner. Chapters are grouped into four interlocking parts that correspond to important changes in Pennsylvania's political economy. Each part includes a brief substantive introduction that ties together the themes of the ensuing chapters. This format enables readers to develop their own synthesis of key socioeconomic and political changes in the state's African American experience over more than three centuries of time.African Americans in Pennsylvania shows how ordinary people have influenced the culture, institutions, and politics of African American communities in Pennsylvania. In the process, it documents the ways that black people have influenced, and continue to influence, the state as a whole.Contributors are Elijah Anderson, John F. Bauman, R. J. M. Blackett, John E.

He was a nationally ranked hockey goalie who played for Colgate on a full scholarship; girls threw themselves at him and his teammates; professional scouts regularly came to see him play; fans cheered him on. Inside, though, Kenny didn't feel like a man.Unlike his macho teammates, Kenny found that despite his attraction to women, he had little sex drive and even less of a sex life. To his great anguish, he repeatedly found himself unable to perform sexually. Despite strenuous workouts, his body remained flabby and soft, earning him the locker room nickname Pear. After graduation and well into his career as a hotshot journalist, Ken's secret problems and confusions grew worse.As a Hollywood correspondent for People magazine, Ken found himself challenged and tormented by the sexually charged atmosphere of Tinseltown. Perpetually confused over the workings of his mind and body, Ken's relationships with women repeatedly fractured. Physically, matters would grow more bizarre as he would one day find himself lactating.The macho culture that reared Ken made it agonizingly difficult for him to seek medical help or even to discuss the true nature of his condition. Eventually other health problems forced him to see a doctor who revealed something that would suddenly lift years of pain, frustration, and confusion.Ken was suffering from a rare, chestnut-sized brain tumor thatflooded his body with massive amounts of the female hormone Prolactin. Although he was a male by nature, Ken's biochemical make-up was increasingly female. Six hours of brain surgery would finally accomplish what years of therapy, rumination, and denial could not. Finally, Ken Baker would be able to feel -- and function -- like a man.At a moment of heated debate over the powers of nature versus nurture, Man Made -- like no other book -- illuminates the biochemical nature of sexuality.

Erik Weihenmayer was born with retinoscheses, a degenerative eye disorder that would progressively unravel his retinas. Erik learned from doctors that he was destined to lose his sight by age thirteen. Yet from early on, he was determined to rise above this devastating disability and lead a fulfilling, exciting life. In Touch the Top of the World, Erik recalls his struggle to push past the limits placed on him by his visual impairment--and by a seeing world. He speaks movingly of the role his family played in his battle to break through the barriers of blindness: the mother who prayed for the miracle that would restore her son's sight; the father who encouraged him to strive for that unreachable mountaintop. Erik was the first blind man to summit McKinley. Soon he became the first blind person to scale the infamous 3000-foot rock wall of El Capitan and then Argentina's Aconcagua, the highest peak outside of Asia. He was married to his longtime sweetheart at 13,000 feet on the Shira Plateau on his way to Kilimanjaro's summit, and recently Erik scaled Polar Circus, the 30,000-foot vertical ice wall in Alberta, Canada. Erik's story is about having the vision to dream big; the courage to reach for near impossible goals; and the grit, determination, and ingenuity to transform our lives into something miraculous.

Rather, the contributors assess the extent to which the kind of phenomenological investigation Husserl initiated favors the construction of a scientific theory of cognition, particularly in contributing to specific contemporary theories either by complementing or by questioning them. What clearly emerges is that Husserlian phenomenology cannot become instrumental in developing cognitive science without undergoing a substantial transformation. Therefore, the central concern of this book is not only the progress of contemporary theories of cognition but also the reorientation of Husserlian phenomenology.Because a single volume could never encompass the numerous facets of this dual aim, the contributors focus on the issue of naturalization. This perspective is far-reaching enough to allow for the coverage of a great variety of topics, ranging from general structures of intentionality, to the nature of the founding epistemological and ontological principles of cognitive science, to analyses of temporality and perception and the mathematical modeling of their phenomenological description.This book, then, is a collective reflection on the possibility of utilizing a naturalized Husserlian phenomenology to contribute to a scientific theory of cognition that fills the explanatory gap between the phenomenological mind and brain.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Jean Petitot", "rating": "3.33", "pages": "672"}, {"id": 2251376, "title": "Bones of the Buried", "blurb": "A murder mystery featuring Lord Edward Corinth and Verity Browne.After six months in New York, Lord Edward returns to London only for his old sparring partner, Verity Browne, to convince him to investigate a murder in Madrid.

But as this anthology shows, women's voices have been there since the early Republic. At Home on This Earth features the most readable and accomplished pieces of nature writing by more than 50 U.S. women authors, from the early 19th century to the present. Spanning a range of genres including memoir, story, journal entry, sketch, and essay, it brings together pieces long out of print by such forgotten authors as Elizabeth C. Wright and Edith Thomas with selections by such well-known and acclaimed authors as Rachel Carson and Alice Walker. Moving far beyond the customary association of nature writing with New England and its Yankee progenitors, the book offers work from across the United States by Jewish, Asian, Hispanic, African American, and Native American women. With its rich diversity in voices, attitudes, and styles, this anthology expands the definition of nature writing, recognizes the specific contribution of women to this genre, and shows their unique relation to the natural world. Designed for undergraduate courses as well as for general readers, the book includes a short biography of the author preceding each selection. A bibliography and list of further reading is included, as well as an index of authors and titles.

Tintin, Calculus and Haddock soon become embroiled in the accusations, and, travelling to San Theodoros to clear their names, find themselves caught in a trap laid by their old enemy, Colonel Sponsz, who has been sent by the East Bloc nation of Borduria to assist Tapioca. Sponsz has concocted the conspiracy of which Tintin and his friends are accused in a plot to wreak revenge upon them for humiliating him in The Calculus Affair. Escaping, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus join Alcazar and his small band of guerrillas, the Picaros, in the jungle near an Arumbaya Indian village.Meanwhile, in a show trial orchestrated by Sponsz, Castafiore is sentenced to life imprisonment and the Thompsons are ordered to be executed by firing squad. Tintin enlists Alcazar's help in freeing his friends, but upon arrival at his jungle headquarters, finds that Alcazar's men have become demoralised drunkards since Tapioca started dropping copious quantities of alcohol near their camp. Additionally, Alcazar is continually henpecked by his shrewish wife Peggy, who nags him constantly about his failure to achieve a successful revolution. Fortunately, Calculus has invented a pill which will make alcohol unpalatable to anyone who ingests it (which he proves to have tested on Haddock, much to the latter's ire). Tintin offers to use the pill to cure the Picaros of their alcoholism if Alcazar agrees to make the overthrow of Tapioca bloodless. Alcazar reluctantly agrees, and as his men are cured, Jolyon Wagg arrives with his musical troupe the Jolly Follies, who intend to perform at the upcoming carnival in San Theodoros. Alcazar \u2014 with a little advice from Tintin \u2014 launches an assault on Tapioca's palace during the carnival by 'borrowing' the troupe's costumes and sneaking his men into the capital. He topples Tapioca, but on Tintin's urging, does not execute him, as is tradition; Tapioca is instead forced to publicly surrender his powers to Alcazar and is exiled, while Sponsz is sent back to Borduria.Meanwhile, Thomson and Thompson are due to be shot on the same day as the carnival (although as naive as ever in their observations, the detectives show courage by refusing to be blindfolded). Tintin and Haddock reach the state prison in time to prevent the executions from taking place. Castafiore, her maid and her pianist are also released, and Alcazar can finally give his wife the palace he has promised. With everything back in order (or not), Tintin and his friends leave. As they fly home, Tintin and Haddock express gratitude about being able to go home, showing a more weary attitude towards travel than in earlier books.The second to last panel shows a final, skeptical political message: as under Tapioca, the city slums are filled with wretched, starving people and patrolled by indifferent police.

He helped found The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade and helped achieve passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807 which ended British trade in slaves. In his later years Clarkson campaigned for the abolition of slavery worldwide - then concentrated in the Americas. In 1840 he was the key speaker at the Anti-Slavery Society's first conference in London whose aim was to end slavery in other countries. It was at Cambridge in 1785 that Clarkson entered a Latin essay competition that was to set him on the course he was to follow for the rest of his life. The topic of the essay was 'Is it lawful to enslave the unconsenting?' and it led him to consider the question of the slave trade, reading everything he could on the subject, including the works of Anthony Benezet, a Quaker abolitionist, as well as first-hand accounts of the African slave trade. After winning the prize Clarkson had what he termed a spiritual revelation from God and this experience, and sense of calling, led him to devote his life to abolishing the slave trade. He published his Latin essay in English translation as a pamphlet in 1786 and as a result was introduced to others sympathetic to abolition, including James Ramsay and Granville Sharp, many Quakers, and other nonconformists. The abolitionist movement had been gathering strength for some years having been formed by Quakers both in Britain and the US, and in 1783 300 Quakers had presented Parliament with the first petition against the slave trade. Clarkson's involvement gained momentum and he continued to publish essays which provided a grounding for William Wilberforce's first abolitonist speech in the House of Commons in 1789, and his 12 propositions. The war with France delayed any progress on the abolitonist cause but in 1804 Clarkson revived his efforts and was particularly active in persuading MPs to back the parliamentary campaign. In 1808, now celebrated as a national figure and model of philanthropy, he published his book History of the Rise, Progess and Accomplishment of the Aboliton of the Slave Trade. The book provides historians with much of the detail of the abolition campaign and is an important record of the movement.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Thomas Clarkson", "rating": "4.09", "pages": "424"}, {"id": 2252578, "title": "Basic Clinical Massage Therapy: Integrating Anatomy and Treatment,  with Real Bodywork DVD", "blurb": "This richly illustrated text teaches the basic techniques of clinical massage therapy by embedding illustrations of internal structures directly into photographs of live models.

What kind of monster would do this? When journalists break the story of a child who's been kidnapped, a young woman who's been brutally raped, or a family who's been slaughtered, that's the question most of us ask. Secrets Can Be Murder exposes the hidden motivations behind the most sinister acts of recent times, with a behind-closed-doors look at these sensational crimes that will astound you.   After weighing in on high-profile cases for CNN, Fox News, Court TV, and MSNBC, author Jane Velez-Mitchell helps us understand these infamous crimes by unmasking the deceptions that turned toxic, exploding in rage and violence.   People lie every day to protect secrets, big and small. From desperate Hollywood personalities covering up their eccentric lifestyles to Bible Belt mothers who take the lives of their own children, Secrets Can Be Murder probes twenty-one separate cases. Each illustrates how leading a double life can land you in prison, and how failing to spot liars can get you killed.   Secrets Can Be Murder offers the inside story on each horrific case, unlocking the jaw-dropping secrets of the accused and revealing the common, innocent mistakes of the victims. After all, many of us have gone out alone late at night like Imette St. Guillen, or partied while on vacation like George Smith and Natalee Holloway.   From Dan Horowitz, the high-profile lawyer whose wife was brutally murdered by a teenage neighbor while Horowitz was defending a housewife accused of murder, to Neil Entwistle, the British husband who ran out of funds for an extravagant American lifestyle, Velez-Mitchell shows how each of these crimes has its own secrets to spill.   Many of us possess the same trusting nature as victims and carry around the same secrets as criminals -- whether it's debt, infidelity, or fetishes. With fascinating new insights from investigators and psychologists plus the friends and family of both the victims and the perpetrators, Secrets Can Be Murder illustrates just how little separates our so-called normal lives from that of a sociopath -- and how you can stay out of harm's way.\n...more", "genre": ["Crime", "True Crime", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Jane Velez-Mitchell", "rating": "3.38", "pages": "352"}, {"id": 2253193, "title": "Creating Powerful Brands in Consumer, Service and Industrial Markets", "blurb": "Written by the author of From Brand Vision to Brand Evaluation, this book gives the professional and the student an understanding of the functioning and management of the modern brand.

A Solo in Tom-Toms, in 1946, took Gene further along his journalistic safari (with many a side excursion). Now Skyline comes to the greatest moments, the grand climax, the New York newspaper days of the 1920s, the time and the town in all their gusto and raw color.As always with Gene Fowler his main story is built up of many stories of the people whom he knew, ranging from mountebanks, impostors, quacks, and bums to the greats that ornamented his days. Thus we meet in Skyline Babe Ruth, Grantland Rice, Ben Hecht, Charles MacArthur, Arthur Brisbane, Will Irwin, Tad, William Randolph Hearst, Jack Dempsey, Herbert Bayard Swope, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Ford, and many another - as well as some assorted kidnappers, panhandlers, defrocked doctors, and numerous colorful reporters of his acquaintance. Occupying a large part of the stage is the fabulous Damon Runyon, whom Fowler met in Eldorado Springs, Colorado, in 1905. He knew him longer and better than did any writing man now alive, and the book contains much new material on Runyon, and many hitherto untold anecdotes and stories of him in his role as Broadway's most fabulous citizen and as one of the leading wits of Park Row.There will never be another Gene Fowler - and there will never be another book quite like this one, with its mixture of tenderness and humor and the rare qualities that make the true storyteller. The last chapter was written on the eve of his seventieth birthday; with a bit added subsequently that hints his knowledge of his rapidly nearing end.

Might as well say she knew it when Edward took his first whaling trip to the Canada River. . . .Lyddie has long been the wife of Edward Berry, a well-liked and successful whaler in Satucket Village, Massachusetts. Married for twenty years, Lyddie is used to the trials of being a whaling wife -- her husband's sudden departures, when whales are sighted in the bay; his long absences at sea, when she must run the house herself; the constant fear that one day Edward will simply not come home. But when the unthinkable does happen and Edward is lost at sea, Lyddie finds that she must bear not only the grief of losing her husband but also the insult of losing her autonomy. As a widow, she finds herself cast into society's cellar, her property and rights now at the whim of her nearest male relative, who happens to be her daughter's husband.With her son-in-law -- who was never Lyddie's first choice for her daughter -- implacable and hostile, Lyddie realizes she cannot live under his roof and under his decrees. Refusing to bow to both her  guardian and the societal and legal pressures brought to bear upon her, Lyddie finds that defying one rule emboldens her to defy another . . . and another. Asshe moves back into the house she shared with Edward -- the house she is entitled to use only one-third of now -- and begins to figure out how she'll make a living on her own, she finds that her defiance earns her nothing but the abuse of friends and neighbors and puts her home and her family at risk. Ultimately, Lyddie must decide how much she values her personal freedom and how willing she is to become estranged from those she loves.While conjuring the hearths and salt air of eighteenth-century colonial America, The Widow's War captures a timeless human longing.

Tazio Nuvolari (1892-1953) is widely regarded as the greatest racing driver of all time. Through the 1930s and into the 1940s his reputation for skill and bravery eclipsed a whole generation of rivals. Even today his name alone evokes a classic era in the history of road and Grand Prix racing. Yet there is no current affordable biography of him in the English language. In this fascinating assessment of Nuvolari's life, Christopher Hilton seeks to understand Nuvolari the man - and the Nuvolari legend as it unfolded. Using original documentary material, race reports of the time from several countries and the recollections of Nuvolari's contemporaries, the author recreates the excitement generated by his driving and the impact it made on motorsport.Nuvolari's virtuosity at the wheel came with a competitive instinct so fierce that he repeatedly broke cars and his own body. The author captures many aspects of Nuvolari's strong personality, a personality which, in the days before intrusive journalism, was virtually unknown. The extraordinary performances that decorated Nuvolari's long career form the backbone of the narrative - the 1930 Mille Miglia, the 1935 German GP, the 1938 British GP at Donington, the 1948 Mille Miglia. Marking the half century after Nuvolari's death, this new biography is an invaluable addition to motor racing history and essential reading for anyone interested in the sport - even if they are followers of modern Formula 1 heroes like the Schumachers, Coulthard and Montoya.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Christopher Hilton", "rating": "4.28", "pages": "256"}, {"id": 2257801, "title": "Cupido es un murci\u00e9lago", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Romance", "Read For School", "Humor"], "author": "Mar\u00eda Fernanda Heredia", "rating": "4.13", "pages": "154"}, {"id": 2257875, "title": "African Americans in Minnesota", "blurb": "African Americans have had a profound influence on the history and culture of Minnesota from its earliest days to the present.

In Against War, he develops a powerful critique of modernity, and he offers a critical response combining ethics, political theory, and ideas rooted in Christian and Jewish thought. Maldonado-Torres focuses on the perspectives of those who inhabit the underside of western modernity, particularly Jewish, black, and Latin American theorists. He analyzes the works of the Jewish Lithuanian-French philosopher and religious thinker Emmanuel Levinas, the Martiniquean psychiatrist and political thinker Frantz Fanon, and the Catholic Argentinean-Mexican philosopher, historian, and theologian Enrique Dussel.Considering Levinas\u2019s critique of French liberalism and Nazi racial politics, and the links between them, Maldonado-Torres identifies a \u201cmaster morality\u201d of dominion and control at the heart of western modernity. This master morality constitutes the center of a warring paradigm that inspires and legitimizes racial policies, imperial projects, and wars of invasion. Maldonado-Torres refines the description of modernity\u2019s war paradigm and the Levinasian critique through Fanon\u2019s phenomenology of the colonized and racial self and the politics of decolonization, which he reinterprets in light of the Levinasian conception of ethics. Drawing on Dussel\u2019s genealogy of the modern imperial and warring self, Maldonado-Torres theorizes race as the naturalization of war\u2019s death ethic. He offers decolonial ethics and politics as an antidote to modernity\u2019s master morality and the paradigm of war. Against War advances the de-colonial turn, showing how theory and ethics cannot be conceived without politics, and how they all need to be oriented by the imperative of decolonization in the modern/colonial and postmodern world.", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Nelson Maldonado-Torres", "rating": "3.88", "pages": "360"}, {"id": 2262753, "title": "The Evolution of Co-Operation", "blurb": "How can co-operation emerge in a world of self-seeking egoists - whether superpowers, businesses, or individuals - when there is no central authority to police their actions?

The city had a jewel-like sparkle, she said, the vast caf\ufffds reminded me of ocean liners powered by the rhythms of their orchestras. There was music everywhere. Eager to look ahead after the crushing defeat of World War I, Weimar Germany embraced the modernism that swept through Europe and was crazy over jazz. But with the rise of National Socialism came censorship and proscription: an art form born on foreign soil and presided over by Negroes and Jews could have no place in the culture of a master race. In Different Drummers, Michael Kater--a distinguished historian and himself a jazz musician--explores the underground history of jazz in Hitler's Germany. He offers a frightening and fascinating look at life and popular culture during the Third Reich, showing that for the Nazis, jazz was an especially threatening form of expression. Not only were its creators at the very bottom of the Nazi racial hierarchy, but the very essence of jazz--spontaneity, improvisation, and, above all, individuality--represented a direct challenge to the repetitive, simple, uniform pulse of German march music and indeed everyday life. The fact that many of the most talented European jazz artists were Jewish only made the music more objectionable.  In tracing the growth of what would become a bold and eloquent form of social protest, Kater mines a trove of previously untapped archival records and assembles interviews with surviving witnesses as he brings to life a little-known aspect of wartime Germany. He introduces us to groups such as the Weintraub Syncopators, Germany's best indigenous jazz band; the Harlem Club of Frankfurt, whose male members wore their hair long in defiance of Nazi conventions; and the Hamburg Swings--the most daring radicals of all--who openly challenged the Gestapo with a series of mass dance rallies. More than once these demonstrations turned violent, with the Swings and the Hitler Youth fighting it out in the streets. In the end we come to realize that jazz not only survived persecution, but became a powerful symbol of political disobedience--and even resistance--in wartime Germany. And as we witness the vacillations of the Nazi regime (while they worked toward its ultimate extinction, they used jazz for their own propaganda purposes), we see that the myth of Nazi social control was, to a large degree, just that--Hitler's dictatorship never became as pure and effective a form of totalitarianism as we are sometimes led to believe. With its vivid portraits of all the key figures, Different Drummers provides a unique glimpse of a counter-culture virtually unexamined until now. It is a provocative account that reminds us that, even in the face of the most unspeakable oppression, the human spirit endures.", "genre": ["Music", "History", "Jazz"], "author": "Michael H.

Or is the pickup the powerful businessman's daughter trying to escape a priveleged background she despises? When Julie Summers' car breaks down in a sleazy street, at a garage a young Arab emerges from beneath the chassis of a vehicle to aid her. The consequences develop as a story of unpredictably relentless emotions that overturn each one's notion of the other, and of the solutions life demands for different circumstances. She insists on leaving the country with him. The love affair becomes a marriage-that state she regards as a social convention appropriate to her father's set and her mother remarried in California, but decreed by her 'grease monkey' in order to present her respectably to his family. In the Arab village, while he is dedicated to escaping, again, to what he believes is a fulfilling life in the West, she is drawn by a counter-magnet of new affinities in his close family and the omnipresence of the desert.

This book looks at the emergence of racial stereotypes during the nineteenth century, the gradual formation of a racial discourse at the turn of the century, the conceptualization of racial nationalism at the beginning of the 1910s, and the institutionalization and habituation of this discourse by the academic community in the 1920s and '30s. It also provides the first analysis of eugenics--the pseudo-science of race improvement--in Republican China. The work is based on a wide variety of sources, some hitherto neglected by sinologists, such as primers on anthropology, genetics and eugenics, pamphlets on racial nationalism, medical handbooks, schoolbooks and caricatures. The author first demonstrates that racial categories of analysis were not confined to the edges of Chinese thought systems, but have been widespread and influential during the past century. Secondly, he argues that racial discourse did not result from 'Western influence' but was largely due to endogenous developments which had only a minimal relationship to Western thought. Thirdly, he dispels the myth of Chinese 'cultural universalism' to show that outgroups were often classified according to physical characteristics alleged to be permanent. And finally, he indicates that this discourse did not exist in isolation of social movements but was part of a symbolic universe in perpetual change. Frank Dikotter's conceptual approach is grounded in discourse analysis, social constructivism and intergroup sociology. He makes detailed comparisons with Western notions of race, and approaches a number of related topics such as Occidentalism, non-Darwinian evolutionism, categorical thought, the construction of emotions, and the misuse of\n...more", "genre": ["Cultural", "China", "History", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Asia", "Race"], "author": "Frank Dik\u00f6tter", "rating": "3.72", "pages": "251"}, {"id": 2267338, "title": "Un Chant De Noel / A Christmas Carol", "blurb": "A Christmas Carol is a novella by English author Charles Dickens.

This sphere brought with it a new type of intellectual\u2014a public man whose role was to interpret and nationalize universal (and largely foreign) ideas and ideologies.Activity within the public sphere took many forms as Japanese intellectuals sought to define their changing roles. At no time was such public activity as intense as during the crisis years of later imperial and early postwar Japan. In contrasting case studies, Andrew E. Barshay presents the lives of two modern Japanese intellectuals, Nanbara Shigeru (1889-1974), professor of Western political thought at Tokyo Imperial University, and Hasegawa Nyozekan (1875-1969), a versatile independent journalist. Through their writings and experiences, Barshay examines the power of the idea of national community in public life. He treats Nanbara's and Hasegawa's ideas and actions as they developed within the contexts of Western intellectual tradition and modern Japanese history. The result is a superbly written narrative that illuminates the complex predicament of modern Japanese intellectuals and their relation to the state and society. Barshay's work is ultimately a study of intellectual mobilization in a modern state, and of the price of national identity in the twentieth century.\n...more", "genre": ["Cultural", "Japan", "History", "History", "Japanese History"], "author": "Andrew E.

Robert Kirk argues that the zombie idea depends on an incoherent view of the nature of phenomenal consciousness.His book has two main aims. One is to demolish the zombie idea once and for all. There are plenty of objections to it in the literature, but they lack intuitive appeal. He offers a striking new argument which reveals fundamental confusions in the implied conception of consciousness. His other main contribution is to develop a fresh and original approach to the true nature of phenomenal consciousness. Kirk argues that a necessary condition is a basic package of capacities. An important component of his argument is that the necessary cognitive capacities are not as sophisticated as is often assumed. By focusing on humbler creatures than ourselves he avoids some of the distracting complications of our sophisticated forms of cognition.The basic package does not seem to be sufficient for phenomenal consciousness. What is also needed is direct activity--a special feature of the way the events which constitute incoming perceptual information affect the system. This is an integrated process, to be conceived of holistically, and contrasts sharply with what is often called the availability or poisedness of perceptual information.This original, penetrating, and highly readable book will be of interest to all who have a serious concern with the nature of consciousness: not only professional philosophers and students, but also many psychologists and neuroscientists.", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Robert Kirk", "rating": "3.29", "pages": "280"}, {"id": 2269918, "title": "The Tom Hanks Enigma: The Biography of the World's Most Intriguing Movie Star", "blurb": "In a career spanning 25 years, Tom Hanks has cemented his position as one of the finest actors of his generation.

While it is well known for establishing racial equality as a central commitment of American schools, the case also inspired social movements for equality in education across all lines of difference, including language, gender, disability, immigration status, socio-economic status, religion, and sexual orientation. Yet more than a half century after Brown, American schools are more racially separated than before, and educators, parents and policy makers still debate whether the ruling requires all-inclusive classrooms in terms of race, gender, disability, and other differences. In Brown's Wake examines the reverberations of Brown in American schools, including efforts to promote equal opportunities for all kinds of students. School choice, once a strategy for avoiding Brown, has emerged as a tool to promote integration and opportunities, even as charter schools and private school voucher programs enable new forms of self-separation by language, gender, disability, and ethnicity. Martha Minow, Dean of Harvard Law School, argues that the criteria placed on such initiatives carry serious consequences for both the character of American education and civil society itself. Although the original promise of Brown remains more symbolic than effective, Minow demonstrates the power of its vision in the struggles for equal education regardless of students' social identity, not only in the United States but also in many countries around the world. Further, she urges renewed commitment to the project of social integration even while acknowledging the complex obstacles that must be overcome.

She considers the kinds of cultural work that this rhetoric has performed and finds that rape has been an insistent figure for a range of social, political, and economic issues.Sielke argues that the representation of rape has been a major force in the cultural construction of sexuality, gender, race, ethnicity, class, and indeed national identity. At the same time, her acute analyses of both canonical and lesser-known texts explore the complex anxieties that motivate such constructions and their function within the wider cultural imagination. Provoked in part by contemporary feminist criticism, Reading Rape also challenges feminist positions on sexual violence by interrogating them as part of the history in which rape has been a convenient and conventional albeit troubling trope for other concerns and conflicts.This book teaches us what we talk about when we talk about rape.

Its root cause is not Russian Bolshevik propaganda, nor the late war, nor the French Revolution, but a process of racial impoverishment, which destroyed the great civilizations of the past and which threatens to destroy our own. This grim blight of civilized society has been correctly diagnosed only in recent years. The momentous biological discoveries of the past generation have revealed the true workings of those hitherto mysterious laws of life on which, in the last analysis, all human activity depends. In the light of these biological discoveries, confirmed and amplified by investigations in other fields of science, especially psychology, all political and social problems need to be reexamined. Such a reexamination of one of these problems-the problem of social revolution-has been attempted in the present book.

Principles of Macroeconomics presents the material in an intuitive way that avoids excessive math. The authors introduce a well-articulated short list of core principles, reinforce them by illustrating and applying each principle in several contexts, and then ask students to work exercises to see what they've learned. The text seeks to create Economic Naturalists; that is, after reading the text, students will ask (and answer) questions about their economic environment. For example, students will see Braille dots on drive-up ATMs and ask why they're there. Peppered with such thought-provoking examples, Frank and Bernanke not only engage students, but teach them to see each feature of their economic landscape as the reflection of an implicit or explicit cost-benefit calculation. culation.", "genre": ["Economics", "Textbooks", "Reference", "Business", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Robert H.

Even after more than three centuries and the revolutions of Einsteinian relativity and quantum mechanics, Newtonian physics continues to account for many of the phenomena of the observed world, and Newtonian celestial dynamics is used to determine the orbits of our space vehicles.This completely new translation, the first in 270 years, is based on the third (1726) edition, the final revised version approved by Newton; it includes extracts from the earlier editions, corrects errors found in earlier versions, and replaces archaic English with contemporary prose and up-to-date mathematical forms. Newton's principles describe acceleration, deceleration, and inertial movement; fluid dynamics; and the motions of the earth, moon, planets, and comets. A great work in itself, the Principia also revolutionized the methods of scientific investigation. It set forth the fundamental three laws of motion and the law of universal gravity, the physical principles that account for the Copernican system of the world as emended by Kepler, thus effectively ending controversy concerning the Copernican planetary system.The illuminating Guide to the Principia by I.

As founder of the Glyconutrients Research Foundation and author (along with Mindy Kitei) of Sugars That Heal, he has found that the addition of essential sugars to your diet can affect everything from the immune system to cholesterol levels. But this doesn't mean you should start heaping table sugar on every meal! Rather, Mondoa proposes that through the use of a few simple supplements, you may be able to fight off colds, lower your blood pressure, or simply have more energy.  \t Mondoa is cautious when mixing research with anecdote and praise. While some people benefit tremendously from supplements, he points out that many supplements aren't well absorbed or assimilated and are of doubtful efficacy. He later goes on to recommend consultations with your health care provider before beginning any of his specific regimens. The sources for these sugar-based supplements vary from shellfish to mushrooms, onions, and bovine tracheal cartilage, and he cautions against using the supplements without checking the ingredients, as those with allergies can experience serious reactions. Mondoa does include a few simple recipes for mushroom tea and vegetable sauce, but most of the glyconutrients are added to your diet through pills, powders, or tinctures; contact information for supplement sources is found at the end of the book. Specific chapters on the immune system, diabetes, chronic fatigue syndrome, and cancers detail the exact combinations of sugars most likely to heal.

His most famous moniker, however, was Stendhal, which he affixed to his greatest work, The Charterhouse of Parma. The author spent a mere seven weeks cranking out this marvel in 1838, setting the fictional equivalent of a land-speed record. To be honest, there are occasional signs of haste, during which he clearly bypassed le mot juste in favor of narrative zing. So what? Stendhal at his sloppiest is still wittier & wiser about human behavior, than just about any writer you could name. No wonder so meticulous a stylist as Paul Val\u00e9ry was happy to forgive his sins against French grammar: We should never be finished with Stendhal. I can think of no greater praise than that. The plot of The Charterhouse of Parma suggests a run-of-the-mill potboiler, complete with court intrigue, military derring-do & more romance than you can shake a saber at. But Stendhal had an amazing, pre-Freudian grasp of psychology (at least the Gallic variant). More than most of his contemporaries, he understood the incessant jostling of love, sex, fear & ambition, not to mention our endless capacity for self-deception. No wonder his hero, Fabrizio de Dongo, seems to know everything & nothing about himself. Even under fire at the Battle of Waterloo, the young Fabrizio has a tendency to lose himself in Napoleonic reverie: Suddenly everyone galloped off. A few moments later Fabrizio saw, 20 paces ahead, a ploughed field that seemed to be strangely in motion; the furrows were filled with water, & the wet ground that formed their crests was exploding into tiny black fragments flung 3 or 4 feet into the air. Fabrizio noticed this odd effect as he passed; then his mind returned to daydreams of the Marshal's glory. He heard a sharp cry beside him: two hussars had fallen, riddled by bullets; & when he turned to look at them, they were already 20 paces behind the escort. The quote above, a famous one, captures something of Stendhal's headlong style. Until now, most English-speaking readers have experienced it via C.K. Scott-Moncrieff's superb 1925 translation. Crammed with life, lust & verbal fireworks, The Charterhouse of Parma demonstrates the real truth of its creator's self-composed epitaph: He lived. He wrote.

Fradkin. The trail of Wells Fargo runs through nearly every imaginable landscape and icon of frontier folklore: the California Gold Rush, the Pony Express, the transcontinental railroad, the Civil and Indian Wars. From the Great Plains to the Rockies to the Pacific Ocean, the company's operations embraced almost all social, cultural, and economic activities west of the Mississippi, following one of the greatest migrations in American history.Fortune seekers arriving in California after the discovery of gold in 1849 couldn't bring the necessities of home with them. So Wells Fargo express offices began providing basic services such as the exchange of gold dust for coin, short-term deposits and loans, and reliable delivery and receipt of letters, money, and goods to and from distant places. As its reputation for speed and dependability grew, the sight of a red-and-yellow Wells Fargo stagecoach racing across the prairie came to symbolize not only safe passage but faith in a nation's progress. In fact, for a time Wells Fargo was the most powerful and widespread institution in the American West, even surpassing the presence of the federal government.Stagecoach is a fascinating and rare combination of Western and business history. Along with its colorful association with the frontier -- Wyatt Earp, Black Bart, Buffalo Bill -- readers will discover that swiftness, security, and connectivity have been constants in Wells Fargo's history, and that these themes remain just as important today, 150 years later.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Business", "Nonfiction", "Literature", "American"], "author": "Philip L.

Among these magical passages, 'the nouns are verbs / the conduit between I and I.' Here, house and inhabitant (as form and content) perpetually exchange their positions, showing 'the snake / swallowing // peristalsis of / the world // by which these rooms // are constituted.'

In life, Polly Baymiller was a fierce and passionate woman ardently in love with her husband and her three sets of twins. Why should she be any different in death?Polly's Ghost begins when Polly, an ethereal, glimpses her nine-year-old son, Tip, for the first time since she died giving birth to him. He's the only baby she never got to hold, to kiss, or to guide from one uncertain moment to the next deliberate one, and it is Tip she has missed most fervently in the years she has spent learning to be a ghost.Love, Polly comes to realize, is not a state of mind but a way of being. One must act on the feeling in order to make it count. And act she does, taking bold steps from above to make sure that Tip has the courage and curiosity he needs to make his own precious way on Earth. Meanwhile, Polly -- drawn into and out of the earthly stories of the unfolding lives of other people -- follows her own path, away from a tormented ghostliness toward an abundant peace.It is a testament to Abby Frucht's talent that this novel explores so ecstatically and yet so bracingly that most sentimental of all subjects -- the relationship between mother and child.

And soon she finds another passion: Kurt Canitz, the dashing young director of the company, and the first man Elizabeth's ever kissed who has really meant something to her. Then Elizabeth's perfect summer is profoundly shaken when Kurt turns out not to be the kind of man she thought he was.Moving and romantic, this coming-of-age story was written during the 1940s. As revealed in an introduction by the author's granddaughter Lena Roy, the protagonist Elizabeth is close to an autobiographical portrait of L'Engle herself as a young woman--vibrant, vulnerable, and yearning for love and all that life has to offer.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Young Adult", "Romance", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Historical", "Young Adult", "Teen", "Novels", "Audiobook", "Realistic Fiction", "Contemporary"], "author": "Madeleine L'Engle", "rating": "3.51", "pages": "7"}, {"id": 2279415, "title": "Das Gewicht des Wassers", "blurb": "Der Segelt\u00f6rn der Fotoreporterin Jean mit ihrer Familie, ihrem Schwager und dessen Freundin sollte eigentlich der Recherche eines \u00fcber 100 Jahre zur\u00fcckliegenden Mordes an zwei jungen Norwegerinnen dienen.

The only thing worse than spending your life earthbound, Neil would learn, is landing hard and knowing you'll never fly again.Born in Penns Castle, in the castle itself, he was a prince of sorts. But when his mother left the castle with him in tow, he lost everything, even his name. He seemed destined for a life as a shopkeeper's barely tolerated stepson.That's when baseball presented itself and saved him. For what Neil could do was hit. Through some combination of reflexes, vision, and coordination, the lean and supple Virginia Rail turned the game of his childhood into the driving force of his life.

In 2000, geophysicist Benjamin Meade's predictions have come true: R-9, one of a 500-mile-long chain of volcanoes in the Mid-Atlantic, has surfaced, spewing mineral ash & volcanic gases that convert to sulfuric acid, which in turn condenses into particles that reflect solar radiation. The massive chain of volcanoes also diverts the tropical current of the N. Atlantic Drift, resulting in drastically lower temperatures. Meade, observing R-9 from his research vessel, Abyss, espies the QE3--its decks lined with British citizens fleeing the country's severe energy shortage caused, in part, by the '95 meltdown of a nuclear reactor that killed thousands--steaming right toward the volcano about to erupt. Despite his frantic radio warnings, the QE3's captain fails to heed. All perish. Meade, in one of many grade-B disaster-movie scenes here, blames himself & gets drunk.

The young son of Julius Caesar and the fabled Cleopatra, Caesarion was seen by some as the hope of the marriage between Rome and Egypt, by others as the folly of a commander's lust for a wanton foreign schemer. For the new Roman ruler, Octavius, Caesarion is the threat that could topple his dreams of a safe and peaceful Roman Empire. The brutal truth is that Caesarion could not be allowed to live. But what if he somehow managed to survive the inevitable assassination and went underground to hide his identity? How would he find a way to live when he has always chosen and honor, even though his life has been shadowed by forces greater than anyone should have to cope with? Caesarion will travel the lands that he thinks he knows so well only to discover that he knew his people not at all. And only after that discovery, when he loses it all and is forced to confront his humanity, will Caesarion finally come to know friendship, honesty, and love.And the essential truth that a man can be noble and true, bereft of land, titles . . . and even a name.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Northern Africa", "Egypt", "Historical", "Roman", "Literature", "Ancient", "Science Fiction", "Alternate History", "African Literature", "Egyptian Literature", "Cultural"], "author": "Gillian Bradshaw", "rating": "3.90", "pages": "447"}, {"id": 2285379, "title": "Disorderly Elements", "blurb": "Like John le Carr, with a deeply cynical sense of humor. \u2022 Ideal for espionage fans looking for something a little different. \u2022 An amusing, civilized, rather wonderful caper, Paper Chase is a charmer\u0097New York Times \u2022 All the elements of a proper espionage yarn, combined with wit and a pair of fine surprises in the denoument\u0097Publishers Weekly \u2022 Delightfully refreshing ...

The trilogy focuses on Harry Talvace, who bears stamped on his face the lineage of Shrewsbury's Norman conquerors. Born to aristocratic parents and nursed by a stone mason's wife, he grows up fiercely loyal to his breast-brother, the sunny, irresistibly charming Adam. Harry also discovers that he has a gift--the ability to carve stone with the sure hand of genius.In his fifteenth year, Harry's devotion to Adam and his obsession to sculpt set into motion the thrilling tale of Volume One, The Heaven Tree. Rebelling against his father and fleeing England to save Adam, Harry finds his destiny entangled in the affairs of commoners and kings, divided by two women--the courageous dark-haired Gilleis and the beautiful courtesan Benedetta--and pledged to the brooding, mysterious Lord of Parfois, Ralf Isambard, who sponsors Harry's monumental creation of a cathedral. And while Wales and France challenge England's crown, these men and women follow their desires toward jealousy, pitiless revenge, and passion so madly glorious neither time nor a merciless execution can end it. In Volume Two, The Green Branch, Harry's son, young Harry Talvace, is drawn into the fabulous intrigues of the court of Llewelyn, Prince of North Wales, and bound by a blood oath to find and kill his father's old enemy, Isambard. Yet the threads that bind his life to the ruthless Isambard are not so easily severed, as Harry falls under the spell of the aging warrior lord.The concluding volume, The Scarlet Seed, brings full circle this tale of implacable enmity and unshakeable loyalty. As a kingdom shudders under the flames of civil war and captor becomes captive, the final siege of Parfois creates a climax to this tale so majestic, noble, and heartbreaking no reader will ever forget it.", "genre": ["Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical", "Medieval", "British Literature", "12th Century", "Classics"], "author": "Edith Pargeter", "rating": "4.31", "pages": "899"}, {"id": 2285857, "title": "Katherine", "blurb": "This novel, described by the San Francisco Chronicle Book Review as nothing short of miraculous, is the story of Zebra Wong, a Chinese girl whose pragmatic mind conflicts with her passionate heart; Lion Head, her classmate, whose penchant for romantic intrigue belies his political ambitions, and Katherine, the seductive American with the red lipstick and the wild laugh who teaches them English and other foreign concepts: individualism, sensuality, the Beatles.

Greeley written such a searing and topical novel about the state of the Catholic Church. The Priestly Sins tells the story of Father Herman Hoffman, a gifted and innocent young man from the distant prairies of the Great Plains. In the first summer of his first parish appointment, Hoffman is swept up in The Crisis after witnessing child abuse in the parish rectory. He tells the pastor, the father of the victim, and the local police but is rebuffed by the archbishop. Soon he is vilified for denouncing a priest who has been cleared by the police and learns the harsh fate of the whistle-blower in the contemporary Catholic church: He is locked up in a mental-health center and then sent into exile to do graduate study. In Chicago to study immigrant history, he encounters the local Vicar for Extern Priests, the legendary Monsignor Blackie Ryan, who helps him regain his confidence. Hoffman returns home to demand a parish of his own from the archbishop. Reluctantly, the church hierarchy assigns him to a dying parish, but by his zeal and charm Hoffman revives the local church. His brief idyll is shattered by a subpoena to testify in a court hearing. If he speaks, he will have to take on the downtown establishment that is determined to destroy him and many of his fellow priests who want to be rid of this painful reminder of a sinful past. Hoffman faces exile not only from his parish, but from the priesthood itself. Writing from the author's fifty years of experience as a priest, The Priestly Sins will be criticized by some but embraced by most as an all-too-candid story of all-too-human priests. The Priestly Sins is Father Greeley's most electrifying novel in three decades, a novel sure to rise up the bestseller lists.", "genre": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Catholic"], "author": "Andrew M.

Sarmiento, and afterwards avid supporter of Juarez Celman, who was the paradigm of the optimism at those times, Lucio Vicente L\u00f3pez's mental clarity gave him the necessary balance to understand the need of a regenerative civilian movement, that at the time seemed to be incarnated by the Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica of Leandro Alem.La gran aldea is a clue novel (roman a clef).

The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored author's cut of Sister Carrie that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing. Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by Sister Carrie's last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. --Rebecca Gleason\n...more", "genre": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Literature", "Literature", "American", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Novels", "Classics", "Classic Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "20th Century", "Academic", "School"], "author": "Theodore Dreiser", "rating": "3.76", "pages": "418"}, {"id": 2287898, "title": "Richard Bangs' Adventures with Purpose: Dispatches from the Front Lines of Earth", "blurb": "Running such wild rivers as the crocodile-infested Tekaze in Ethiopia, Richard Bangs used to lived for the adrenalin, for the rush of reveling in the misery of hardship and sidestepping death around every bend.

Going to his first game as a kid in 1940s New York was the start of a lifelong love affair. This heartfelt valentine to America's game evokes a simpler time in our country's history: complete with the smells of popcorn, beer, and hotdogs; the sight of the green, closely-mowed infield; the dark-brown dirt paths; the crisp white uniforms; the sound of the excited voices of announcers; the crack of the bat; and the roar of the crowd. Baseball, he discovered, is its own unique universe. When he finally had the opportunity to personally interview legendary manager Leo Durocher, Larry was so happy that he kept the return phone message for twenty years, just so he could look at it and remember the day. Over his long and distinguished career he's had the opportunity to meet and interview such heroes as Casey Stengel, Jackie Robinson, and Ted Williams. Passion for the game has suffused his life. Even now, he revels in the Orioles and the Mets. Every reason to love baseball is laid out in this nostalgic book, as King gives an inside view to the trading cards, the scuffles, the most classic plays, the labor disputes, and the personalities that pervade the sport. It is the only team game without a clock or a designated ending time. Larger-than-life personalities make up its history. Why I Love Baseball will appeal to anyone who recognizes baseball as America's favorite pastime. King has loved baseball for as long as he can remember, and this ode to the game is truly a love song. You can hear the joy in the author's voice. In a time of serious national focus, Larry King's personal reminiscences and unique view of the impact of baseball is a welcome look atthe modern history of the game.\n...more", "genre": ["Sports", "Baseball", "Sports", "Sports", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook"], "author": "Larry King", "rating": "3.65", "pages": "0"}, {"id": 2288278, "title": "Photo Op (Squabbin Bay, Maine Series #1)", "blurb": "Dena's been in love before she loved and lost a wonderful man twenty years ago.

One of the narrators of Matthew Kneale's ambitious historical novel English Passengers has more modest aspirations: Captain Illiam Quillian Kewley wants only to smuggle a little tobacco, brandy, and French pornography from the Isle of Mann to a secluded beach in England. Yet somehow in the process, he and his crew end up weighing anchor for Australia. Worse, they're forced to carry three temperamental Englishmen bound for Tasmania on a mission to discover the exact location of the Garden of Eden. The year is 1857, and the study of geology is beginning to make serious inroads into areas of religious doctrine. When the Reverend Geoffrey Wilson runs across a scientific treatise that puts the age of Silurian limestone somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred thousand years, he is scandalized: This was despite the fact that the Bible tells, and with great clarity, that the earth was created a mere six thousand years ago. His many attempts to prove the Bible's accuracy lead, eventually, to a scientific expedition comprising himself, Timothy Renshaw, a dilettante botanist, and Dr. Thomas Potter.  Now jump back 30 years, to 1828, when a revolution of sorts is stirring on the island of Tasmania. Over the years, white settlers have been encroaching on aboriginal land and relations have deteriorated into violence. At the heart of the action is Peevay, a young half-breed abandoned by his aborigine mother, who had been kidnapped and raped by a white escaped convict. Now his vengeful mother is leading a war against the whites, and Peevay, desperate to win her love, has joined her. Chapters from the past narrated by Peevay and augmented by letters and dispatches from white settlers alternate with the sections told by Kewley, Wilson, Renshaw, and Potter. Eventually, of course, the two time lines intersect with momentous results.  War, mutiny, shipwreck, and not a little farce make English Passengers a gripping read, but it is Matthew Kneale's literary ventriloquism that renders it remarkable. In a novel with so many different points of view, the individuality of each voice stands out. There is, for instance, the mutinous Dr. Potter, whose descent into paranoia and egomania results in diary entries reminiscent of a 19th-century psychotic Bridget Jones: Manxmen = treacherous even to v. last. Self heard Brew (lashed to mainmast as per usual) instructing helmsman to steer N.N.W. When self questioned he re. this he claiming we = carried into Bay of Biscay by difficult sea currents + must set course to avoid Breton Peninsular. He pointing to distant point of land to N.N.E. claiming this = Brittany. Self = doubtful. But perhaps the most compelling voice in English Passengers belongs to Peevay, who paints a vivid picture of aboriginal life in a foreign tongue he nonetheless makes his own:  When we sat so in the dark, after our eating, Tartoyen told us stories--secret stories that I will not say even now--about the moon and sun, and how everyone got made, from men and wallaby to seal and kangaroo rat and so. Also he told who was in those rocks and mountains and stars, and how they went there. Until, by and by, I could hear stories as we walked across the world, and divine how it got so, till I knew the world as if he was some family fellow of mine.  By the close of this epic tale, the world Peevay had known is gone forever and the lives of the Manx sailors and English passengers have been irrevocably changed. Based on real events in Tasmanian history, Matthew Kneale's novel delivers a home truth about Australia's brutal colonial past, even as it conveys the wonder and allure of the age of exploration. --Alix Wilber", "genre": ["Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Australia", "Historical", "Travel", "Adventure", "Tasmania"], "author": "Matthew Kneale", "rating": "4.06", "pages": "462"}, {"id": 2288734, "title": "He That Will Not When He May", "blurb": "This Elibron Classics book is a facsimile reprint of a 1881 edition by Bernhard Tauchnitz, Leipzig.Originally serialized in MacMillan's Magazine, Volumes CLI and XLII, November 1879 to October 1880.\nThis Elibron Classics book is a facsimile reprint of a 1881 edition by Bernhard Tauchnitz, Leipzig.Originally serialized in MacMillan's Magazine, Volumes CLI and XLII, November 1879 to October 1880.\n...more", "genre": ["Classics", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical", "Victorian", "Literature", "19th Century"], "author": "Mrs. Oliphant", "rating": "3.65", "pages": "502"}, {"id": 2288744, "title": "The Library Window", "blurb": "Ostensibly a ghost story, The Library Window is also an exploration of what is real and what is not, or, as the author says, A Story of the Seen and Unseen.

Benson was a forgotten man of English letters, remembered only by a few enthusiasts of his supernatural fiction. But over the last decade this has all changed, as successful TV adaptations of his comic masterpieces, the Mapp and Lucia stories, have transformed his reputation and led to the reissue of his best comic novels. Now, Jack Adrian, an authority on twentieth-century popular fiction, has brought together twenty-six of Benson's delightful short stories, some of which are newly discovered, and most of which have never been publishedin book form. In Desirable Residences we find all of Benson's archetypical characters--absurd, gossipy socialites, appalling meddlers, and hapless males--sketched with a fine satirical wit, and juxtaposed in hilarious short stories. Benson's typical tale involves the humorous misadventures of his sorry, butlovable crew of main characters. One story relates the catastrophe which ensues when a pair of misogynistic bachelors mistakenly think they have solved their domestic problems by investing in the latest household appliances (electricity, they hoped, would take the place of a staff of greedy, incompetent females). Adrian includes several of Benson's society stories (such as The Drawing Room Bureau, in which a feud develops between two fashionable women over who will be able to divulge the most classified information from their sources at the War Office), and four depicting TheDiversions of Amy Bondham, a meddlesome social climber who is revived on her death bed when her husband reads to her the lineage of the Duke she has just visited. A typically pointed Benson passage has Amy complaining of the dreary social scene: There had been so many pianists, so many singers, so many operations, and though a play by West African cannibals was a novelty, there would be risks in asking these artists to her house....She would never forgive herself if any of her guests were killed or eaten. Benson's taste for the bizarre is well represented, and the collection includesthree of his ghost stories (which he like to call spook stories). Throughout, Benson creates memorable, often absurd characters--from the unfortunate Miss Mapp (featured in the title story) to the priceless Dodo to humorous hypochondriacs like Dicky Pepys and Bertram Potter. Like his dozens of novels, these stories show Benson to be a master of many genres--from the society spoof to the chilling supernatural tale.

For short, dark, scrappy Karin is the survivor in a family filled with fractured personalities:  If I tried to describe my family, and that's exactly what I'm going to do, you could probably say that Anni drank to forget. I drank to be happy. Father drank just to keep going. Grandma drank to sleep better at night. Aunt Selma drank to be even meaner than she already was.  And Julie, Karin informs us, is the only one who drinks sensibly--unfortunately! It did her no good. She didn't forget, she wasn't happy, she couldn't sleep and she was never mean. Told mainly in flashback, Ullmann's first novel traces the unhappy history of the Blom family--Anni's mother, June, and her sister Selma, whose rivalry over Anni's father caused a permanent rift; Anni's own unsuccessful union with Karin and Julie's father; and Julie's failing marriage to a man she's sure is unfaithful to her. Ullmann takes the reader from Norway to New York and back again as she weaves past into present, gradually creating a fully dimensional portrait of these women and their relationships to men and to each other. If Anni gets by on charm and melodrama, and Julie on her beauty, then Karin relies on a combination of willpower and lies to carry her through. In the end, it seems her strategy is best.  If the emotional tangles and subtle workings of this novel seem reminiscent of an Ingmar Bergman film, Linn Ullmann comes by it honestly. The daughter of Bergman and the actress Liv Ullmann, she has inherited her father's eye for what lies beneath the most placid-seeming surfaces, and her mother's less-is-more delivery.\tBut Ullmann is a talent unto herself, and the novel's rather downbeat themes are nicely buoyed by Karin's slightly sardonic narrative. --Margaret Prior", "genre": ["Fiction", "Novels", "Scandinavian Literature", "Contemporary", "20th Century", "Literary Fiction", "Literature"], "author": "Linn Ullmann", "rating": "3.35", "pages": "291"}, {"id": 2289629, "title": "With Lee in Virginia", "blurb": "The Civil War, as seen through the eyes of young Vincent Wingfield, a spirited teenager from the South and heir to a southern slave plantation, who staunchly supports the rights of slaves but, because of fidelity to the state of Virginia, joins Lee's cavalry and fights for the Confederacy.\nThe Civil War, as seen through the eyes of young Vincent Wingfield, a spirited teenager from the South and heir to a southern slave plantation, who staunchly supports the rights of slaves but, because of fidelity to the state of Virginia, joins Lee's cavalry and fights for the Confederacy.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Military History", "Civil War", "Adventure", "Classics", "Young Adult", "War", "Historical", "Childrens", "Literature"], "author": "G.A.

But Diane Coyle argues that economics today is more soulful than dismal, a more practical and human science than ever before. Building on the popularity of books such as Freakonomics that have applied economic thinking to the paradoxes of everyday life, The Soulful Science describes the remarkable creative renaissance in how economics is addressing the most fundamental questions--and how it is starting to help solve problems such as poverty and global warming. A lively and entertaining tour of the most exciting new economic thinking about big-picture problems, The Soulful Science uncovers the hidden humanization of economics over the past two decades.Coyle shows how better data, increased computing power, and techniques such as game theory have transformed economic theory and practice in recent years, enabling economists to make huge strides in understanding real human behavior. Using insights from psychology, evolution, and complexity, economists are revolutionizing efforts to solve the world's most serious problems by giving policymakers a new and vastly more accurate picture of human society than ever before. They are also building our capacity to understand how what we do today shapes what the world will look like tomorrow. And the consequences of these developments for human life, for governments, and for businesses are only now starting to be realized--in areas such as resource auctions, pollution-credit trading, and monetary policy.The Soulful Science tells us how economics got its soul back--and how it just might help save the planet's.\n...more", "genre": ["Economics", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Diane Coyle", "rating": "3.34", "pages": "288"}, {"id": 2289898, "title": "The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai", "blurb": "Yehuda Amichai (1924-2000) was Israel's most popular poet, as well as a literary figure of international reputation.

First published in 1916, this engaging classic tells the tale of a thin, pale 9-year-old orphan named Elizabeth Ann who is whisked away from her city home and relocated to a Vermont farm where her cousins, the dreaded Putneys, live. The Putneys are not as bad as her doting, high-strung Aunt Frances warns, however, and Elizabeth, who had been nurtured by her aunt like an overwatered sapling--positively blooms under their breezy, earthy care. Elizabeth Ann's first victories are small ones--taking the reins from Uncle Harry, doing her own hair, making her own breakfast--but children will revel in the awakening independence and growing self-confidence of a girl who learns to think for herself... and even laugh. Along the way, citified readers of all ages will get a glimpse into the lives of people who are truly connected to the world around them--making butter (We always bought ours, says Elizabeth Ann), experiencing the rapt wonder that people in the past were really people, and understanding the difference between failing in school and failing at life. Fisher is a wise, personable storyteller, steeped in the Montessori principles of learning for its own sake, the value of process, and the importance of indirect support in child rearing. She also captures the tempestuous emotional life of a child as few authors can, crafting a story that children will find deeply satisfying. And in the end, readers will have grown as fond of the happier, stronger Betsy as the gentle, unassuming Putneys have.

Children celebrated victories and mourned defeats, tightened their belts and widened their responsibilities, took part in patriotic displays and suffered shortages and hardships, fled their homes to escape enemy invaders and snatched opportunities to run toward the promise of freedom. Offering a fascinating look at how children were affected by our nation's greatest crisis, James Marten examines their toys and games, their literature and schoolbooks, the letters they exchanged with absent fathers and brothers, and the hardships they endured. He also explores children's politicization, their contributions to their homelands' war efforts, and the lessons they took away from the war. Drawing on the childhoods of such diverse Americans as Jane Addams, Booker T. Washington, and Theodore Roosevelt, and on sources that range from diaries and memoirs to children's amateur newspapers, Marten examines the myriad ways in which the Civil War shaped the lives of a generation of American children.An original-minded, skillfully and suggestively presented history, haunting in its detailed unfolding of a war that put so many already vulnerable youngsters in danger, but elicited from some of them, as well, impressively sensitive, responsive thoughts, gestures, and deeds in what became, as this extraordinary book's title insists, their civil war.--Journal of American HistoryJames Marten's thoroughly researched and engagingly written study . . . stands as one of the most exciting studies to emerge in the last dozen years. . . .

Para Guenon, como para el pensamiento B+esotericoB; de todos los tiempos, el orden humano no es sino la expresion del orden cosmico, reflejo, a su vez, del orden divino, pues una rigurosa relacion de semejanza o analogia preside la relacion entre todos los niveles del ser. En consecuencia, las relaciones entre autoridad espiritual y poder temporal son analogas a las existentes entre el conocimiento y la accion.

This is true, for he does show theoretically why there is no need for us to age, i.e. that there is no death gene that determines, more or less precisely, our longevity. Just don't expect any miracle cures. From a layman's viewpoint, the evolutionary argument he constructs for the development of aging in species is well elucidated and highly convincing. Aging is not, according to the disposable soma theory expounded here, anything to do with population control or some such crudely deterministic mechanism, but rather the genes making the best of what are, after all, limited energy resources. Our soma cells (anything but the all-important and immortal germ-line cells by which we reproduce) are constantly being replicated, a process that, carried out in any sort of energy-efficient manner, leaves room for error. And these errors are cumulative in effect; though the process is generally remarkably accurate, a faultily constructed cell cannot produce a perfect cell, and eventually our bodies will go wrong with fatal consequences. This mattered less when the conditions of life were such that reaching a state of senescence was relatively rare. But with the change in these conditions found in modern industrialized countries, the effects of this process have taken on a far greater significance. As well as the science (all very accessible to the nonscientist), Tom Kirkwood also engages the reader in an interesting and important discussion of the social and cultural implications of these changed conditions. For the time being, though, as far as any of us are concerned, aging is still inevitable. This book doesn't offer the hope of evading death or even delaying it that significantly, but it does offer up some hope: understanding a process can help to demystify it and dispel fear, and, as Kirkwood illustrates, it can help us to try and intelligently influence the processes at work in our favor.

Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has managed to wangle one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the American occupation of postwar Berlin. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles on a murder--an American soldier washed up on the shore of the conference grounds--he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What he finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation and a city not only physically but morally devastated, where children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and the black market is the only means of survival.Berlin at zero hour is like nowhere else--a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. And nothing is simple--not the murder of a soldier and not any of the lives, American and German, that Jake encounters as he tries to solve it.

It offers a strong political narrative with balanced coverage of social, cultural/intellectual, economic and women's history. The scholarship is second to none. THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE provides an interpretive and analytical approach which will appeal to professors who want their students to come away from their courses with not only a grasp of the \u0093facts,\u0094 but also having been challenged by interpretations, having analyzed assumptions, and having used their critical thinking skills. The lavish map and illustration program provides visual sources to aid students in learning, and the carefully chosen art program with its long explanatory captions provides a strong art history element to the text. The book presents a chronological survey of the history of the West while weaving the narrative around several recurring themes: social structure, the body politic, organization of production and the impact of technology, evolution of the family and changing gender roles, war, religion and cultural expression. This helps students to understand the continuing thread of development that exists throughout history. In developing the seventh edition, the authors focused on increasing the coverage of women and the family throughout the text in an integrated fashion, increasing the coverage of popular culture, and increasing the number of \u0093historical debate\u0094 boxes that proved so popular in the sixth edition. The Medieval chapters (6-11) have been significantly revised by new author Barbara Hanawalt.

Las religiones, afirma Armstrong, nacieron como respuesta espiritual al odio, los conflictos y la rabia. Examinando las aportaciones de figuras como Buda, Socrates, Confucio, Jeremias, Ezequiel o los desconocidos misticos del Upanishad, la autora explora en las raices de nuestras tradiciones religiosas para comprender las claves del presente que brotan de un pasado espiritual comun.", "genre": ["Religion", "History", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Spirituality", "Theology", "Judaism"], "author": "Karen Armstrong", "rating": "4.04", "pages": "500"}]
