Bridging the Atlantic Ocean by steamship was a defining, remarkable feat of the era. Over time, Atlantic steamships became the largest, most complex machines yet devised. They created a new transatlantic world of commerce and travel, reconciling former Anglo-American enemies and bringing millions of emigrants to transform the United States.In Transatlantic, the experience of crossing the Atlantic is re-created in stunning detail from the varied perspectives of first class, steerage, officers, and crew. The dynamic evolution of the Atlantic steamer is traced from Brunel's Great Western of 1838 to Cunard's Mauretania of 1907, the greatest steamship ever built.

One of the Modern Library's hundred greatest books of the twentieth century, Robert Caro's monumental book makes public what few outsiders knew: that Robert Moses was the single most powerful man of his time in the City and in the State of New York. And in telling the Moses story, Caro both opens up to an unprecedented degree the way in which politics really happens--the way things really get done in America's City Halls and Statehouses--and brings to light a bonanza of vital information about such national figures as Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt (and the genesis of their blood feud), about Fiorello La Guardia, John V. Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller.But The Power Broker is first and foremost a brilliant multidimensional portrait of a man--an extraordinary man who, denied power within the normal framework of the democratic process, stepped outside that framework to grasp power sufficient to shape a great city and to hold sway over the very texture of millions of lives. We see how Moses began: the handsome, intellectual young heir to the world of Our Crowd, an idealist. How, rebuffed by the entrenched political establishment, he fought for the power to accomplish his ideals. How he first created a miraculous flowering of parks and parkways, playlands and beaches--and then ultimately brought down on the city the smog-choked aridity of our urban landscape, the endless miles of (never sufficient) highway, the hopeless sprawl of Long Island, the massive failures of public housing, and countless other barriers to humane living. How, inevitably, the accumulation of power became an end in itself.Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He was held in fear--his dossiers could disgorge the dark secret of anyone who opposed him. He was, he claimed, above politics, above deals; and through decade after decade, the newspapers and the public believed. Meanwhile, he was developing his public authorities into a fourth branch of government known as Triborough--a government whose records were closed to the public, whose policies and plans were decided not by voters or elected officials but solely by Moses--an immense economic force directing pressure on labor unions, on banks, on all the city's political and economic institutions, and on the press, and on the Church. He doled out millions of dollars' worth of legal fees, insurance commissions, lucrative contracts on the basis of who could best pay him back in the only coin he coveted: power. He dominated the politics and politicians of his time--without ever having been elected to any office. He was, in essence, above our democratic system.Robert Moses held power in the state for 44 years, through the governorships of Smith, Roosevelt, Lehman, Dewey, Harriman and Rockefeller, and in the city for 34 years, through the mayoralties of La Guardia, O'Dwyer, Impellitteri, Wagner and Lindsay, He personally conceived and carried through public works costing 27 billion dollars--he was undoubtedly America's greatest builder.This is how he built and dominated New York--before, finally, he was stripped of his reputation (by the press) and his power (by Nelson Rockefeller).

Though black workers tried to protest workplace inequities through their unions, their efforts were largely ineffective until passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act opened the way for scores of antidiscrimination lawsuits.

They cannot interfere with the free will or decision-making process of any Earthling, but are here to educate and help raise the vibrations of all who choose to journey to the new dimension the Earth is entering. They are also commissioned to help us understand the true nature of God, ourselves, and the universes.Who are these Beings and why are they here? Are they friends, foes or merely observers? The answer to these questions may come from the words of the Arcturians themselves :We wish only to be accepted on the Earth plane for the gifts and benefits that we bring. We try to do our jobs with total dedication to the Light and to the sisters and brothers of Earth, whom we serve.We would like for this document to be read as the comparison of two different worlds.We look for ways to belong. We do not wish to be considered separate in a universe that is only one.We are talking about a transit of time, over the next several years, that will transform the energy of the beloved Earth to a Garden of Eden in the galaxy.\n...more", "genre": ["Spirituality", "Philosophy", "Science Fiction", "Aliens", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Metaphysics"], "author": "Norma J.

For Phillips, the Christian concept of eternal life does not denote the endless survival of the soul after death, but rather refers to the type of life that one ought to be living and attaining in our present mortality.--Loyd Ericson\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "D.Z.

Did German capitalists undermine the Weimar Republic, finance the Nazi Party, and use their influence on behalf of Hitler's appointment to the chancellorship of Germany? For half a century, such charges as these have been repeatedly made, and today one of the most widely held explanations for the Third Reich's origins places prime responsibility on Germany's leading corporations. Astonishingly, this subject has never been adequately explored--and until now it was commonly believed that the records that might throw light on this important connection had been either lost or destroyed. In the pages of this groundbreaking book, Henry Ashby Turner, Jr., shows us that these records do indeed exist. And the evidence that leads him to his startling conclusion--that big business did not, on balance, support Hitler's political program--overthrows many of our conventional ideas about the rise of Hitler's regime.German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler takes us through the major corporate archives of Weimar and Nazi Germany and inside the executive offices of the giants of Germany industry--I. G. Farben, Flick, Krupp, Siemens, and many others. It shows us the dynamics between corporations and political machines, businessmen and politicians, industrial associations and political parties. Beginning with an examination of the heritage of German big business and the role it played in the politics of the Weimar Republic, Turner scrutinizes the attitudes of the Nazi Party leadership--Hitler in particular--toward economic issues and big business. He then traces the known contacts between the Nazis and the men of big business down to the triumph of Nazism in 1933. For the first time, the story is told form both sides, employing documentation from Nazi as well as business sources. In the course of assessing the significance of financial contributions to Hitler's party, the author provides the first systematic analysis of Nazism's sources of income. He also gives us a new window, not only on Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, but also on the behavior of 20th-century private corporations, their executives, and their influence on our times. As much a book about business history as about the Nazi era, this volume gives us a new window, not only on Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, but one through which we can view the behavior of twentieth-century private corporations, their executives, and their influence on our times.\n...more", "genre": ["History"], "author": "Henry Ashby Turner Jr.", "rating": "4.27", "pages": "528"}, {"id": 1804795, "title": "More Simple Quilts with Splash, Dash & Panache", "blurb": "More Simple Quilts with Splash, Dash & Panache\n is the sequel title to Simple Quilts that Look Like a Million Bucks.

The Great Depression, World War II, and the civil rights movement brought increased social and political involvement, and the Women's Department worked to make the sanctified world of the church interact with the broader American society.

Miten paljon toisesta ihmisest\u00e4 voi ottaa vastuuta? Miten hyvin l\u00e4heist\u00e4k\u00e4\u00e4n ihmist\u00e4 voi tuntea? Voiko l\u00e4heisi\u00e4 pett\u00e4\u00e4 ja esiinty\u00e4 aivan toisena kuin oikeasti on?Leena Lehtolainen on Vesannolla syntynyt kirjailija.

Driven from their lands by French colonial soldiers, Nour's tribe has come to the valley of the Saguiet El Hamra to seek the aid of the great spiritual leader known as Water of the Eyes. The religious chief sends them out from the holy city of Smara into the desert to travel still further. Spurred on by thirst, hunger, and suffering, Nour's tribe and others flee northward in the hopes of finding a land that can harbor them at last.The second narrative relates the contemporary story of Lalla, a descendant of the Blue Men. Though she is an orphan living in a shantytown known as the Project near a coastal city in Morocco, the blood of her proud, obstinate tribe runs in her veins.

Physical complaints--allergies, fever, sore throat, inflammation, cysts, backache, migraines, sinus problems, sciatica, dizzy spells, and even cancer--are all signs of deep tensions inside of us are seeking expression. This is why, given the same genetic foundation, one individual develops a specific illness while another remains in good health. Drawing on 20 years of experience and several thousand individual consultations with patients, Michel Odoul shows the \u201cproof\u201d of this lies in the clear correspondences between emotional and mental tensions and specific ailments. The author reveals how every illness or trauma is a signal of incredible precision: The part of the body affected pinpoints what your inner being is trying to tell you and what you need to work through emotionally. Providing a reference grid of body-mind connections, he explains, for example, how skin conditions reflect difficulties with aggression from the outside world and knee problems indicate inflexibility or tension in relationships. He shows not only how each side of the body has specific meanings and connections to emotions, relationships, and family but also how the upper and lower halves of the body have specific connections--together forming four quadrants with unique Yin-Yang balances, where Yin represents emotional issues and Yang represents action/inaction. He also explores the role of the meridians of Chinese medicine in distributing emotional and mental energy throughout the body. Offering keys to decipher what the body is trying to tell us, the author shows that we can learn to see physical ailments not as something caused by chance or fate but as a message from our heart and soul. By releasing the energies and patterns they point to, we can return to a state of health and forward movement on our path through life.\n...more", "genre": ["Self Help", "Nonfiction", "Health"], "author": "Michel Odoul", "rating": "3.64", "pages": "240"}, {"id": 1811053, "title": "Empire of the Ants", "blurb": "Here is the stunning international bestseller in the tradition of Watership Down but with a dark, original twist.

Unique, daring, and unforgettable, it tells the story of an ordinary family who accidentally threaten the security of a hidden civilization as intelligent as our own--a colony of ants determined to survive at any cost....Jonathan Wells and his young family have come to the Paris flat at 3, rue des Sybarites through the bequest of his eccentric late uncle Edmond. Inheriting the dusty apartment, the Wells family are left with only one warning: Never go down into the cellar.But when the family dog disappears down the basement steps, Jonathan follows--and soon his wife, his son, and various would-be rescuers vanish into its mysterious depths.Meanwhile, in a pine stump in a nearby park, a vast civilization is in turmoil. Here a young female from the russet ant nation of Bel-o-kan learns that a strange new weapon has been killing off her comrades. To find out why, she enlists the help of a warrior ant, and the two set off on separate journeys into a harsh and violent world. It is a world where death takes many forms--savage birds and voracious lizards, warlike dwarf ants and rapacious termites, poisonous beetles and, most bizarre of all, the swift, murderous, giant guardians of the edge of the world: cars.Yet the end of the female's desperate quest will be the eerie secret in the cellar at 3, rue des Sybarites--a mystery she must solve in order to fulfill her special destiny as the new queen of her own great empire. But to do so she must first make unthinkable communion with the most barbaric creatures of all. Empire of the Ants is a brilliant evocation of a hidden civilization as complex as our own and far more ancient. It is a fascinating realm where boats are built of leaves and greenflies are domesticated and milked like cows, where citizens lock antennae in absolute communication and fight wars with precisely coordinated armies using sprays of glue and acids that can dissolve a snail.

It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of the African\u2014Kunta Kinte\u2014but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins.

Excited by the prospect of living the American dream for a few weeks, she eagerly trades her desk, job and London flat with a colleague she's never met for the bright lights of Manhattan and a step up the career ladder at Schneider Fox, one of the world's leading ad agencies. Through necessary transatlantic phone calls regarding cat and plant care, Suze begins to build a picture of the person she's swapped lives with, and finds herself increasingly looking forward to his calls. But whilst Suze's career is going from strength to strength under the expert tutelage of Shelley, one of Schneider Fox's leading career women, Lloyd's stay in London is not going so well. When Suze uncovers a plot to oust Lloyd from his job, she finds herself pulling out all the stops to help him, despite the fact they've never met. As Suze asks herself why she's putting her neck on the line for a perfect stranger, she realises that her feelings for Lloyd are driven by more than just concern for a fellow colleague; whilst on the other side of the Atlantic Lloyd becomes ever more curious about the lively, vivacious voice on the end of the line, and realises he wants to know more about the woman who's willing to risk all to help him. Witty, engaging and peppered with interesting and entertaining characters, Perfect Strangers is a lively and fast-paced tale with many twists, turns and heart-stopping moments--and, strangely enough, a perfect ending.

His intention was not to teach farming but rather to supplement existing good farming practices with a spiritual understanding of the forces of nature.

He identified many of these forces and described specific practices and preparations that enable the farmer to work in concert with them.This new edition, with extensive notes and appendices, brings together all of the material related to the Agriculture Course, including the lectures and discussions, Steiner's handwritten notes, diagrams and illustrations, color plates of Steiner's blackboard drawings, and further agricultural indications by Steiner.

The date was October 20, 1934, just days after Diz\u2019s Cardinals won the World Series. The place was Boston\u2019s Fenway Park, under portable lights. The money behind it was Henry Ford\u2019s, who yearned to see an all-white (and non-Jewish) team defeat the black all-stars.

First, it serves as the theoretical underpinning for his theory of communicative action, a crucial element in his theory of society. Second, it contributes to ongoing philosophical discussion of problems concerning meaning, truth, rationality, and action. By the pragmatic dimensions of language, Habermas means those pertaining specifically to the employment of sentences in utterances. He makes clear that formal is to be understood in a tolerant sense to refer to the rational reconstruction of general intuitions or competences. Formal pragmatics, then, aims at a systematic reconstruction of the intuitive linguistic knowledge of competent subjects as it is used in everyday communicative practices. His program may thus be distinguished from empirical pragmatics--for example, sociolinguistics--which looks primarily at particular situations of use.This anthology brings together for the first time, in revised or new translation, ten essays that present the main concerns of Habermas's program in formal pragmatics. Its aim is to convey a sense of the overall purpose of his linguistic investigations while introducing the reader to their specific details, in particular to his theories of meaning, truth, rationality, and action.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas", "rating": "4.06", "pages": null}, {"id": 1812815, "title": "Kissing Frosty/ The Boss, the Baby and the Bride", "blurb": "MAGIC IN THE AIR . . .

Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., father of three and a clinical psychiatrist, has thought long and hard about what makes children feel good about themselves and the world they live in. Now, in The Childhood Roots of Adult Happiness, Dr. Hallowell shares his findings with all of us who care about children. As Dr. Hallowell argues, we don\u2019t need statistical studies or complicated expert opinions to raise children. What we do need is love, wonder, and the confidence to trust our instincts. This inspiring book outlines a 5-step plan that all parents can use in giving their children the gift of happiness that will last a lifetime. Connection, play, practice, mastery, and recognition: as fundamental as these five concepts are, they hold the key to raising children with healthy self-esteem, moral awareness, and spiritual values. Dr. Hallowell explores each step in depth and shows how they work together to foster trust, respect, and joy.Privilege, wealth, and expensive \u201cextras\u201d are not necessary for happiness\u2014there are many stories here of children who have overcome poverty, abandonment, and shocking deprivation to find true fulfillment. Dr. Hallowell encourages us as parents to reconnect with the moments in our own childhoods that made a difference; he explores the impact of genetics and environmental factors on the inner workings of a child\u2019s mind; and he discusses how activities like team sports, community service, religious observance, and household chores can foster a child\u2019s sense of mastery. Like the works of T. Berry Brazelton and Benjamin Spock, The Childhood Roots of Adult Happiness is infused with the wisdom and humanity of a doctor who truly loves and understands children. Writing with the warmth of a friend and the authority of an expert, Dr. Hallowell gives us a book at once practical and exuberant, joyous and informative, eye-opening and reassuring. Ultimately, this book is a celebration of childhood and of the magic that happens between parents and the children they love.From the Hardcover edition.", "genre": ["Parenting", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Education", "Self Help", "Family", "Adhd"], "author": "Edward M.

She survived and was scheduled to appear in court as the key witness against her attacker. But after moving to another town to escape her past, one morning she was found brutally murdered in her garden. Everyone believed the killer was her past attacker, but there was not enough evidence to convict him--until ten years later when a local district attorney working the cold cases used Helena's own DNA research to finally bring her killer to justice. Pointing from the Grave is not only a riveting true-crime story but also a fascinating history of the development of DNA research and its role in forensics, taking the reader on a virtual history of DNA with hard science presented in a very accessible and exciting way.

A week later, conservative pundit Robert Novak revealed in his newspaper column that Ambassador Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame Wilson, was a CIA operative. The public disclosure of that secret information spurred a federal investigation and led to the trial and conviction of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, and the Wilsons' civil suit against top officials of the Bush administration. Much has been written about the Valerie Plame story, but Valerie herself has been silent, until now. Some of what has been reported about her has been frighteningly accurate, serving as a pungent reminder to the Wilsons that their lives are no longer private. And some has been completely false -- distorted characterizations of Valerie and her husband and their shared integrity.   Valerie Wilson retired from the CIA in January 2006, and now, not only as a citizen but as a wife and mother, the daughter of an Air Force colonel, and the sister of a U.S. marine, she sets the record straight, providing an extraordinary account of her training and experiences, and answers many questions that have been asked about her covert status, her responsibilities, and her life. As readers will see, the CIA still deems much of the detail of Valerie's story to be classified. As a service to readers, an afterword by national security reporter Laura Rozen provides a context for Valerie's own story.

The new dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, instituted a reign of terror and turned Chile into a laboratory to test the poisonous prescriptions of the American economist Milton Friedman. In 1985, Litt\u00edn returned to Chile disguised as a Uruguayan businessman. He was desperate to see the homeland he\u2019d been exiled from for so many years; he also meant to pull off a very tricky stunt: with the help of three film crews from three different countries, each supposedly busy making a movie to promote tourism, he would secretly put together a film that would tell the truth about Pinochet\u2019s benighted Chile\u2014a film that would capture the world\u2019s attention while landing the general and his secret police with a very visible black eye.

What she has discovered is a brutal, Hobbesian world in which intense pricing pressure from Western companies combines with ubiquitous corruption and a lack of transparency to exact an unseen and unconscionable toll in human misery and environmental damage. In a way, Harney shows, what goes on in China is inevitable. In a country with almost no transparency, where graft is institutionalized and workers have little recourse to the rule of law, incentives to lie about business practices vastly outweigh incentives to tell the truth. Harney reveals that despite a decade of monitoring factories, outsiders all too often have no idea of the conditions under which goods from China are made. She exposes the widespread practice of using a dummy or model factory as a company's false window out to the world, concealing a vast number of illegal factories operating completely off the books. Some Western companies are better than others about sniffing out such deception, but too many are perfectly happy to embrace plausible deniability as long as the prices remain so low. And in the gold-rush atmosphere that's infected the country, in which everyone is clamoring to get rich at once and corruption is rampant, it's almost impossible for the Chinese government's own underfunded regulatory mechanisms to do much good at all.But perhaps the most important revelation in The China Price is how fast change is coming, one way or another. A generation of Chinese flocked from the rural interior of the country to its coastline, where its factory work largely is, in the largest mass migration in human history. But that migration has slowed dramatically, in no small part because of widespread disenchantment with the way of life the factories offer. As pollution in China's industrial cities worsens and their infrastructure buckles, and grassroots activism for more legal recourse grows, pressures are mounting on the system that will not dissipate without profound change. Managing the violence of that change is the greatest challenge China faces in the near future, and managing its impact on the world economy is the challenge that faces us all.", "genre": ["China", "Nonfiction", "Business", "Economics", "Politics", "Audiobook", "History"], "author": "Alexandra Harney", "rating": "3.71", "pages": "336"}, {"id": 1815718, "title": "Gott stirbt am Nil", "blurb": "Nawal el Saadawi's classic tale attempts to square Islam with a society in which women are respected as equals is as relevant today as ever.

In three years, she\u2019s taken on some of Lake Tahoe\u2019s most controversial cases and has turned her struggling one-woman law firm into a thriving practice. Now she\u2019s ready to sort out her complex relationship with her boyfriend, Monterey P.I. Paul van Wagoner. So she\u2019s heading to the Carmel Valley, the place where she began her career and where her estranged father lives. It\u2019s also a place of dramatic contradictions and hidden tensions, of new wealth and old families. And, within days of her arrival, Nina is already feeling the heat, as a case of arson exposes some of the darkest secrets of her hometown. Two suspicious fires have already raged through the valley this summer, igniting suspicions of arson. When a third blaze ends in a fatality, police zero in on a suspect: Wish, the son of Sandy Whitefeather, Nina\u2019s ex-assistant. The dead man is identified as Wish\u2019s childhood friend, a troubled local auto mechanic who hated the changes wealthy newcomers had brought to the valley. Nina and Paul are certain that there is more to this strange case than meets the eye. As they work together to clear Wish, new, more frightening questions are raised, and another fire is set. And out of the flames a terrifying picture emerges: a community steeped in secrets and rage, a tangled history between two men, and a killer whose motives are dark and wrenching.

Like Dylan and McCartney he is an icon and a living legend. He has sold tens of millions of records, played sell-out concerts all over the world and been central to the significant musical developments of his era. His guitar playing has seen him hailed as 'God'. Tracks such as Layla, Sunshine Of Your Love, Wonderful Tonight and Tears In Heaven have become anthems for generations of music fans. Now for the first time, Eric tells the story of his personal and professional journeys in this pungent, witty and painfully honest autobiography. Eric was born illegitimate in 1945 and raised by his grandparents. He never knew his father and until the age of nine believed his absentee mother to be his sister. In his teens his solace was the guitar and he soon became a cult hero in the club circuits of Britain.With the foundation of the world's first super group Cream in 1966 he became a world superstar. But the rock star lifestyle has had a darker side. In more than forty years at the forefront of his profession he has twice survived near fatal addictions to drugs and alcohol, the death of his four-year-old son, the deaths of friends such as Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon, the break-up of marriage and the disintegration of relationships with a succession of beautiful women. These are the memoirs of a survivor, someone who has reached the pinnacle of success, who has had it all, but whose demons have never left him. At the age of 62, Eric is now ready to tell his story as it is, hiding nothing, with a directness and searing honesty that will make this book one of the most compelling memoirs of our time.", "genre": ["Music", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Biography Memoir", "History"], "author": "Eric Clapton", "rating": "3.82", "pages": "384"}, {"id": 1817775, "title": "An Unexpected Family", "blurb": "Can an old betrayal turn into a brandnew beginning?

The Zero Train has the intensity of Dostoevsky and a love affair as touching as that of Doctor Zhivago. The setting is Siding No 9, a remote Soviet railway settlement run by the secret police and serving the so-called Zero Train. The cargo of this sealed 100-wagon train is unknown to the employees of the siding as is the train's provenance; some suspect something sinister and become obsessed by the mystery. The attempted disentanglement of the mystery, which leads to madness and murder, is at the heart of the novel. The train itself forms the basis of a dense web of symbols examining the nature of life lived in the service of an ideal neither known or understood, thus allowing The Zero Train to be read as a study of the ordinary individual under Stalin. The novel begins with Don Domino, an old man, watching a now almost deserted settlement unable to comprehend in his gathering insanity that the track is no longer there and that the Zero Train has stopped passing through.

This question, which has been debated recently by doctors and scientists in the pages of Time magazine and the New York Times, proves that there is still a great deal to learn about women's reproductive health. Female Fertility and the Body-Fat Connection is the record of one scientist's groundbreaking and decades-long work on the connections among fertility, body fat, and reproductive health in women.Rose E. Frisch explains here how, in women, a certain amount of body fat is crucial to the reproductive system and sexual maturation. Women who are too lean are infertile and cannot conceive children; young girls who are too thin have a delayed onset of their first period. Female Fertility and the Body-Fat Connection illuminates how and why a critical fitness level underlies a woman's reproductive health. In the process Frisch gives readers a comprehensive view of the research done to date on the relationship between body composition and fertility and also describes her own journey as a woman scientist working to advance her critical-fitness hypothesis both to the general public and the scientific community. Frisch answers the questions every woman has about the desirable weight for health and fertility and even includes tables to help women find their own best weight. She also demonstrates how important diet and exercise are for the long-term reproductive health of women, and shows what factors influence the onset of puberty in girls. Each milestone of the reproductive life span is affected by food intake and energy output, the factors affecting the storage of fat. Female Fertility and the Body-Fat Connection is a cornerstone to understanding the health of girls and women.\n...more", "genre": ["Health"], "author": "Rose E.

She's endured dead-end jobs and a broken engagement. Even her hair's a mess! But that's going to change now that she's taken over her late grandmother's matchmaking business. All Annabelle has to do is land the Windy City's hottest bachelor as her client, and she'll be the most sought-after matchmaker in town. Nothing is going to stand in her way -- not the drunk lying comatose under her car, not her family's disapproval, and certainly not the lingering effects of a broken heart.With his money green eyes and calculated charm, Heath Champion is the best sports agent in the country. He's wealthy, driven, and gorgeous, so why does he need a matchmaker, especially a red-haired screw-up like Annabelle Granger? True, she's entertaining, and she does have a certain quirky appeal. But Heath is searching for the ultimate symbol of his success -- the perfect wife. And to make an extraordinary match, he needs an extraordinary matchmaker, right?Thin, rich, utterly fabulous Portia Powers has spent her career making matches for everyone but herself. Her take-no-prisoners attitude has built Power Matches into the top matchmaking agency in Chicago. So what if she has more enemies than friends and she's one breath away from a nervous breakdown? Neither an upstart like Annabelle Granger nor Heath Champion's menacing, but oddly intriguing, bodyguard, will keep her from getting what she wants -- a Power Match for Heath ... the city's very own Jerry Maguire.Soon everyone in Chicago has a stake in the outcome, right down to Annabelle's overprotective book club. When the matchmaker promises she'll do anything to keep her star client happy ... does she mean anything?

When Clastres arrived in Paraguay, there were only 100 Guayaki left, and their culture seemed doomed by influenza and encroaching civilization. Clastres's description of his encounters with these people is respectful, self-aware, and written with great skill. Paul Auster (author of The New York Trilogy and the movie Smoke) translated the book from French to English in the late 1970s, sent it to a publisher, and then lost track of the manuscript for 20 years. Fortunately, one of Auster's fans stumbled upon the manuscript in a used-book store in 1996 and brought it to the author, making this publication possible. According to Clastres, the Guayaki were mild-mannered folk who relished the taste of human flesh. There were far more men than women in the community, which seems sort of sinister. Every June, when the air was cold enough to make the bees logy, all the Guayaki groups gathered for a honey festival, which featured tickling games and many sexual adventures. In short, the Guayaki led lives very different from our own. There is something deeply satisfying about learning the details of faraway, drastically foreign lives. Clastres manages to describe these people's daily lives and traditions without making them seem exotic or sensationalizing their story. Clastres's quiet, detailed observations honor this vanished culture and should be of interest to anthropologists and layman alike. --Jill Marquis\n...more", "genre": ["Anthropology", "Travel", "Nonfiction", "Social Science", "Academic", "College", "History", "Humanities", "Reference", "Research", "Academic", "Read For School", "Academic"], "author": "Pierre Clastres", "rating": "4.03", "pages": "311"}, {"id": 1824167, "title": "Der Aufmacher: Der Mann, Der Bei Bild Hans Esser War", "blurb": "Deutschlands einflu\u00dfreichste Zeitung l\u00fcgt, f\u00e4lscht und hetzt -- das ist das Ergebnis der Recherchen des bekannten Enth\u00fcllungsjournalisten G\u00fcnter Wallraff, der sich unter dem Namen Hans Esser 1977 f\u00fcr vier Monate bei Bild in Hannover einschlich.

So glaubte man zumindest. Das Prinzip der Bild-Zeitung bzw. der Boulevard-Zeitung schlechthin ist denkbar einfach und wird von Wallraff gekonnt aufgezeigt: Innerhalb einer strengen Hierarchie m\u00fcssen schlecht bezahlte Redakteure vor Superlativen strotzende Geschichten abliefern, die nur dann politisch sein d\u00fcrfen, wenn diejenigen, die Bild unterst\u00fctzen, es wollen.

Da\u00df bei dieser t\u00e4glichen Volksverdummung, der Freakshow zum Mitnehmen, Menschen in den Tod gehetzt werden, wird bedenkenlos hingenommen.

Der Redakteur versucht am Telefon, doch noch seine Geschichte zu bekommen: Sie reden doch nur so, Sie trauen sich das ja doch nicht richtig. Ein weiterer Dialog: Da haben sich zwei Kinder mit Kleinkalibergewehren beschossen. -- Dufte, prima. Tot?! -- Nee, nur schwer verletzt. Redaktionsalltag. Wallraff erfuhr auch, wie Bild sich im Wahlkampf engagiert, verbal auf die sogenannten Linken einpr\u00fcgelt und den Populisten zur Macht verhilft. Da wird posiert und in Szene gesetzt, wird positive Publicity gegen st\u00e4ndige Verf\u00fcgbarkeit und gewisse Gef\u00e4lligkeiten getauscht, wird ganz nebenbei ein konservativ-reaktion\u00e4res Weltbild der arbeitenden Bev\u00f6lkerung vermittelt.

Originally from Wisconsin, Korth came to Alaska in his twenties, and he never left. Across the years, he's carved out a subsistence life like no other--a life bounded by the migrating caribou herds, by the dangers of suddenly swollen rivers, and by the very exigencies of daily survival.Journalist James Campbell has spent two years documenting the lives of Heimo, his wife, Edna, and their teenage daughters, Rhonda and Krin, and he paints their portraits in vivid detail: evenings listening to the distant voices from the radio's Trapline Chatter show; months spent waiting for the odd small plane to bring supplies; years relying on hard-learned hunting and survival skills that are all that stand between the family and a terrible fate. But it's a complicated existence, too, of encroaching environmental pressures and the fear that this life might be disappearing forever--and how will his two teenage daughters react when one of them goes back to civilization for her high school years?But always at the center there's Heimo Korth, a man who escaped a tough father and a circumscribed life, then reinvented himself in the Alaskan wilderness, only to witness the most unbearable of tragedies, a tragedy that keeps him and his family tied to this inhospitable and beautiful land forever.By turns inspiring and downright jolting, James Campbell'sextraordinary book reads like a rustic version of the American Dream--and reveals for the very first time a life undreamed of by most of us, outside of the mainstream, alone in a stunning wilderness that for now, at least, remains the final frontier.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Adventure", "Environment", "Nature", "Adventure", "Survival", "Travel", "History", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Nature", "Outdoors", "Biography Memoir"], "author": "James   Campbell", "rating": "4.25", "pages": "320"}, {"id": 1829707, "title": "Mighty Stories, Dangerous Rituals: Weaving Together the Human and the Divine", "blurb": "Bringing together two of our greatest sources of meaning and transformation  This book marries two partners that are made for each other.

The result, as in all good unions, is mutual enrichment and deeper life. --Jack Shea, author of Stories of God  Now available in paperback, this moving and enlightening book presents us with a compelling vision of what can happen when we take the opportunity to connect stories and rituals--a vision of individuals and communities transformed through a deeper sense of connection to our loved ones, our communities, and God. Herbert Anderson and Edward Foley reveal how when stories and rituals work together, they have the potential to be both mighty and dangerous--mighty in their ability to lift us up and help us make these connections beyond ourselves and dangerous in challenging us to learn to live with complexity and contradiction.  They show how much more meaningful a baptism, wedding, or funeral can be when liturgy is made to include and recognize the personal stories of those involved. Suddenly, these familiar life-cycle rituals are infused with new life as their participants become connected in a narrative web linking past and present, human and divine. Newly created rituals can also help us connect our stories to the divine story, giving meaning to what we experience and bringing us closer to God.   Ministers, worship leaders, and pastoral caregivers can use this approach to storytelling and ritual to find ways to bring together worship and pastoral care, diminishing fragmentation and fostering coherence in their religious communities.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Theology", "Nonfiction", "Religion", "Academic", "Grad School"], "author": "Herbert Anderson", "rating": "3.94", "pages": "224"}, {"id": 1829710, "title": "Pi razy drzwi", "blurb": "John D. Barrow's Pi in the Sky is a profound -- and profoundly different -- exploration of the world of mathematics: where it comes from, what it is, and where it's going to take us if we follow it to the limit in our search for the ultimate meaning of the universe. Barrow begins by investigating whether math is a purely human invention inspired by our practical needs. Or is it something inherent in nature waiting to be discovered?In answering these questions, Barrow provides a bridge between the usually irreconcilable worlds of mathematics and theology. Along the way, he treats us to a history of counting all over the world, from Egyptian hieroglyphics to logical friction, from number mysticism to Marxist mathematics. And he introduces us to a host of peculiar individuals who have thought some of the deepest and strangest thoughts that human minds have ever thought, from Lao-Tse to Robert Pirsig, Charles Darwin, and Umberto Eco.

His philosophical work was also particularly concerned with the question of human freedom, a preoccupation which also guided his historical researches.

Sluggish economic growth, high unemployment, an addiction to expensive social welfare entitlements, a dwindling birth-rate among native Europeans, and most important, an increasing Islamic immigrant population chronically underemployed yet demographically prolific--all point to a future in which Europe will be transformed beyond recognition, a shrinking museum culture riddled with ever-expanding Islamist enclaves. Decline and Fall tells the story of this decline by focusing on the larger cultural dysfunctions behind the statistics. The abandonment of the Christian tradition that created the West's most cherished ideals--a radical secularism evident in Europe's indifference to God and church--created a vacuum of belief into which many pseudo-religions have poured. Scientism, fascism, communism, environmentalism, multiculturalism, sheer hedonism-- all have attempted and failed, sometimes bloodily, to provide Europeans with an alternative to Christianity that can show them what is worth living and dying for. Meanwhile a resurgent Islam, feeding off the economic and cultural marginalization of European Muslims, knows all too well not just what is worth dying for, but what is worth killing for. Crippled by fashionable self-loathing and fantasies of multicultural inclusiveness, Europeans have met this threat with capitulation instead of strength, appeasement and apologies instead of the demand that immigrants assimilate. As Decline and Fall shows, Europe's solution to these ills--a larger and more powerful European Union--simply exacerbates the problems, for the EU cannot address the absence of a unifying belief that can spur Europe even to defend itself, let alone to recover its lost grandeur. As these problems worsen, Europe will face an unappetizing choice between two somber destinies: a violent nationalistic or nativist reaction, or, more likely, a long descent into cultural senescence and slow-motion suicide.", "genre": ["Islam"], "author": "Bruce S.

However, Amy's career path is fraught with ennui and loss, and the latest tragedy to befall her only underlines her life's emptiness and fragility. There are certainly some fine passages in The Chrome Suite, and its early chapters are absorbing and well-constructed. The most striking turn has the main character struck by lightning: And then I remember clearly how the air in front of me suddenly quivered.... I felt myself falling backwards, and in the final dim split-second of consciousness, I remember hearing voices. Unfortunately this epiphany comes at the beginning of the story, and the author doesn't really give the protagonist anywhere to go or do that can compare. The evocation of the '50s is mostly cartoon kitsch (hence the chrome kitchen suite of the title), and the plot and general ambience bear a remarkable resemblance to that of Margaret Laurence's The Diviners but without that novel's humanity. Amy Barber, a figure at once self-pitying and mean-spirited, cannot generate the empathy we feel for Morag in Laurence's epic tale. The Chrome Suite is an interesting read, but it stands as an artifact of the trendy nihilism of the early '90s rather than a great novel, and its author has mercifully moved on to better things (as in The Russl\u00e4nder). --Robyn Gillam", "genre": ["Canada"], "author": "Sandra Birdsell", "rating": "3.35", "pages": "364"}, {"id": 1831702, "title": "Hack/Slash Volume 3: Friday the 31st", "blurb": "Surviving the first horror movie is tough.

In 1942, when World War II exploded onto its shores, it was an inhospitable, cursorily mapped, disease-ridden land of dense jungle, towering mountain peaks, deep valleys, and fetid swamps. Coveted by the Japanese for its strategic position, New Guinea became the site of one of the South Pacific's most savage campaigns. Despite their lack of jungle training, the 32nd Division's Ghost Mountain Boys were assigned the most grueling mission of the entire Pacific campaign: to march 130 miles over the rugged Owen Stanley Mountains and to protect the right flank of the Australian army as they fought to push the Japanese back to the village of Buna on New Guinea's north coast. Comprised of National Guardsmen from Michigan and Wisconsin, reserve officers, and draftees from across the country, the 32nd Division lacked more than training\u2014they were without even the basics necessary for survival. The men were not issued the specialized clothing that later became standard issue for soldiers fighting in the South Pacific; they fought in hastily dyed combat fatigues that bled in the intense humidity and left them with festering sores. They waded through brush and vines without the aid of machetes. They did not have insect repellent. Without waterproof containers, their matches were useless, and the quinine and vitamin pills they carried, as well as salt and chlorination tablets, crumbled in their pockets. Exhausted and pushed to the brink of human endurance, the Ghost Mountain Boys fell victim to malnutrition and disease. Forty-two days after they set out, they arrived two miles south of Buna, nearly shattered by the experience. Arrival in Buna provided no respite. The 32nd Division was ordered to launch an immediate assault on the Japanese position. After two months of furious\u2014sometimes hand-to-hand\u2014combat, the decimated division finally achieved victory. The ferocity of the struggle for Buna was summed up in Time magazine on December 28, 1942, three weeks before the Japanese army was defeated: Nowhere in the world today are American soldiers engaged in fighting so desperate, so merciless, so bitter, or so bloody. Reminiscent of classics like Band of Brothers and The Things They Carried, this harrowing portrait of a largely overlooked campaign is part war diary, part extreme adventure tale, and\u2014through letters, journals, and interviews\u2014part biography of a group of men who fought to survive in an environment every bit as fierce as the enemy they faced.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "World War II", "War", "Military", "Military History", "War", "Military Fiction", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Cultural", "Asia", "Biography", "History", "World History"], "author": "James   Campbell", "rating": "4.01", "pages": "0"}, {"id": 1832896, "title": "The Wright Brothers: A Flying Start", "blurb": "As young men, Orville and Wilbur Wright had a dream.

Far from a monolithic theistic tradition, the religion comprises thousands of gods, a complex caste system, and hundreds of languages and dialects. Such internal plurality inspires vastly ranging rites and practices amongst Hinduism's hundreds of millions of adherents. It is therefore not surprising that scholars have been hesitant to define universal Hindu beliefs and practices. In this book, Axel Michaels breaks this trend. He examines the traditions, beliefs, and rituals Hindus hold in common through the lens of what he deems its identificatory habitus, a cohesive force that binds Hindu religions together and fortifies them against foreign influences. Thus, in his analysis, Michaels not only locates Hinduism's profoundly differentiating qualities, but also provides the framework for an analysis of its social and religious coherence.Michaels blends his insightful arguments and probing questions with introductions to major historical epochs, ample textual sources as well as detailed analyses of major life-cycle rituals, the caste system, forms of spiritualism, devotionalism, ritualism, and heroism. Along the way he points out that Hinduism has endured and repeatedly resisted the missionary zeal and universalist claims of Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists. He also contrasts traditional Hinduism with the religions of the West, where the self is preferred to the not-self, and where freedom in the world is more important than liberation from the world.Engaging and accessible, this book will appeal to laypersons and scholars alike as the most comprehensive introduction to Hinduism yet published. Not only is Hinduism refreshingly new in its methodological approach, but it also presents a broad range of meticulous scholarship in a clear, readable style, integrating Indology, religious studies, philosophy, anthropological theory and fieldwork, and sweeping analyses of Hindu texts.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Nonfiction", "Religion", "Hinduism"], "author": "Axel Michaels", "rating": "4.11", "pages": "448"}, {"id": 1832976, "title": "America's Cup", "blurb": "Once a competition held exclusively for wealthy members of the New York Yacht Club, the America's Cup has undergone significant transformations in the 20th century.

Worse yet, some writers have clearly abused psychobiography--for instance, to grind axes from the right (Nancy Clinch on the Kennedy family) or from the left (Fawn Brodie on Richard Nixon)--and others have offered woefully inept diagnoses (such as Albert Goldman's portrait of Elvis Presley as a splitpersonality and a delusional paranoid). And yet, as Alan Elms argues in Uncovering Lives, in the hands of a skilled practitioner, psychobiography can rival the very best traditional biography in the insights it offers. Elms makes a strong case for the value of psychobiography, arguing in large part from example. Indeed, most of the book features Elms's own fascinating case studies of over a dozen prominent figures, among them Sigmund Freud (the father of psychobiography), B.F. Skinner, Isaac Asimov, L. FrankBaum, Vladimir Nabokov, Jimmy Carter, George Bush, Saddam Hussein, and Henry Kissinger. These profiles make intriguing reading. For example, Elms discusses the fiction of Isaac Asimov in light of the latter's acrophobia (fear of heights) and mild agoraphobia (fear of open spaces)--and Elms includesexcerpts from a series of letters between himself and Asimov. He reveals an unintended subtext of The Wizard of Oz--that males are weak, females are strong (think of Scarecrow, Tin Man, the Lion, and the Wizard, versus the good and bad witches and Dorothy herself)--and traces this in part to Baum'schildhood heart disease, which kept him from strenuous activity, and to his relationship with his mother-in-law, Matilda Joslyn Gage, a distinguished advocate of women's rights. And in a fascinating chapter, he examines the abused childhood of Saddam Hussein, the privileged childhood of George Bush, and the radically different psychological paths that led these two men into the Persian Gulf War. Elms supports each study with extensive research, much of it never presented before--for instance, on how some of the most revealing portions of C.G. Jung's autobiography were deleted in spite of hisprotests before publication. Along the way, Elms provides much insight into how psychobiography is written. Finally, he proposes clear guidelines for judging high quality work, and offers practical tips for anyone interested in writing in this genre. Written with great clarity and wit, Uncovering Lives illuminates the contributions that psychology can make to biography. Elms's enthusiasm for his subject is contagious and will inspire would-be psychobiographers as well as win over the most hardened skeptic\n...more", "genre": ["Psychology"], "author": "Alan C.

This collection of modern-day interpretations brings together the wisdom, sensitivity, and spirituality of the biblical story with the struggles and insights of contemporary women. Readers will be moved and inspired by these essays.--Susannah Heschel Editor of On Being a Jewish FeministWith Reading Ruth, two creative scholars have brought together an amazingly eclectic group of Jewish novelists, essayists, poets, rabbis, psychologists, and scholars--including Cynthia Ozick, Marge Piercy, Francine Klagsbrun, and Nessa Rapoport--to explore one of the most beloved stories in the Bible. In lively essays, poetry, fiction, and personal narrative, the gamut of women's experience in the modern world is illuminated by this ancient story. Whether the essayists explore relationships between sisters, the complex bond between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the place of the other in society, the heartache of loss, the limitations of loyalty, or the elaborate connections of family, they give voice to an exciting array of thought and interpretation that endows this sacred tale with new life.[A] rich, diverse, and thought-provoking collection.--Judith Plaskow Author of Standing Again at SinaiFilled with passion, humor, insight, and just the right combination of irreverence and awe, Reading Ruth puts the Book of Ruth right where it belongs--in the hands of women.

How would these people feel when their prophecy remained unfulfilled? Would they admit the error of their prediction, or would they readjust their reality to make sense of the new circumstances?We've all experienced the futility of trying to change a strong conviction, especially if the convinced person has some investment in his belief. We're familiar with the variety of ingenious defenses with which people protect their convictions, managing to keep them unscathed thru the most devastating attacks. But human resourcefulness goes beyond simply protecting a belief. Suppose an individual believes something with a whole heart; suppose further a commitment to this belief, suppose irrevocable actions have been taken because of it; finally, suppose evidence, unequivocal and undeniable evidence, that the belief is wrong: what will happen? The individual will frequently emerge, not only unshaken, but even more convinced of the truth of such beliefs than ever before. Indeed, s/he may even show a new fervor about convincing and converting others to this view. How and why does such a response to contradictory evidence come about? This is the question on which this book focuses. We hope that, by the end of the volume, we will have provided an adequate answer to the question, an answer documented by data.When Prophecy Fails is a classic text in social psychology authored by L. Festinger, H. Riecken and S. Schachter. It chronicles the experience of a UFO cult that believed the end of the world was at hand. In effect, it's a sociopsychological study of a modern group that predicted the destruction of the world & the adjustments made when the prediction failed to materialize. The authors have done something as laudable as it is unusual for social psychologists. They espied a fleeting social movement important to a line of research they were interested in and took after it. They recruited a team of observers, joined the movement & watched it from within under great difficulties until its crisis came and went. Their report is of interest as much for the method as for the substance.--Everett C.

As I think I told you, I wrote it five years ago, in Paris, on the implement called bidet as a writing desk--because we lived in one room and I had to use our small bathroom as a study. The book in question was The Real Life of Sebastian Knight. And despite its humble origins, Nabokov's first novel in English showed him to be in absolute command of his adopted language. Like many of the author's later triumphs, this one revolves around a question of identity. The late Sebastian Knight, we discover, was a transplanted Russian novelist whose taste for linguistic trickery bears a certain resemblance to Nabokov's. Now his half-brother is attempting to reconstruct the existence of this elusive figure. As he readily admits, the raw material isn't exactly the stuff of melodrama: Sebastian's life, though far from being dull, lacked the terrific vigour of his literary style. But even the most mundane facts prove difficult for the narrator to nail down. He does, on the other hand, describe Sebastian's creative processes in exquisite and accurate detail:  His struggle with words was usually painful and this for two reasons. One was the common one with writers of his type: the bridging of the abyss lying between expression and thought; the maddening feeling that the right words, the only words are awaiting you on the opposite bank in the misty distance, and the shudderings of the still unclothed thought clamouring for them on this side of the abyss.  Sebastian's real life--or anybody's, for that matter--refuses to yield up a verbal equivalent. Still, the narrator manages a kind of fraternal fusion with his subject on the book's final page, which suggests a fluid and very Nabokovian view of identity itself. For this reason, and for the splendors of its prose, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight is a necessary read. It's also safe to say that it's the very best novel ever written on a bidet. --James Marcus\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Cultural", "Russia", "Literature", "Russian Literature", "Novels", "Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Literature", "20th Century", "Literature", "American", "Mystery"], "author": "Vladimir Nabokov", "rating": "3.94", "pages": null}, {"id": 1836200, "title": "Dolores Claiborne", "blurb": "Psychologiczny bed\u0105cy b\u0142yskotliwym studium charakteru i ciemnych stron kobiecej psychiki, literacki triumf Kinga, jego najambitniejsze dzie\u0142o.Mieszka\u0144cy Little Tall Island czekali blisko 30 lat, by dowiedzie\u0107 si\u0119, co przydarzy\u0142o si\u0119 m\u0119\u017cowi Dolores Claiborne, Joemu, pewnego dnia latem 1963 roku podczas ca\u0142kowitego za\u0107mienia s\u0142onca.

There he sought anonymity, taking an apartment in a run-down district with his sometime collaborator Iggy Pop, another refugee from drugs and debauchery, while they explored the city and its notorious nightlife. In this intensely creative period, Bowie put together three classic albums -- Low, Heroes, and Lodger -- with collaborators who included Brian Eno, Robert Fripp, and Tony Visconti. He also found time to produce two albums for Iggy Pop--The Idiot and Lust For Life--and to take a leading role in a movie, the ill-starred Just A Gigolo.

How about a darb? When was the last time you got the straight skinny at a rap session or told someone to keep on truckin'? How many once-popular American words aren't you using these days? Quite a few, if you're like most people. Thousands of words and expressions entered American English between 1900 and 1999. Every era from the Roaring Twenties to the Me Decade brought its own fads and trends and the language to go with them: fresh youth slang, up-to-the-minute buzzwords, and colorful catch phrases. Most of this new vocabulary exploded into the vernacular, only to fizzle a few years later as trendier trends and more current events demanded new terminology.  Giving yesterday's words another chance to sparkle before they retire to the archives for good, Dewdroppers, Waldos, and Slackers focuses on language that still resonates with the mood of its times. These are words that most Americans would once have recognized, if not actually used. Nothing says Sixties like groovy, even though this resilient piece of slang was heard as early as the 1940s, lingered into the 1970s, and amazingly, is making a twenty-first century comeback. A nostalgic word trip through the highs and lows of American English from the last century, this book pays special attention to words that enjoyed a brief vogue only to end up abandoned and nearly forgotten: one-reelers, bulls, jet jockeys, keypunch operators, the bugged-out and the slackers.

She flees her village and takes refuge in a Franciscan sisterhood. Before long, Sybille's unusual powers bring her under the scrutiny of the Inquisition. Michel, a pious and compassionate monk sent to hear her confession, finds himself drawn more intimately into Sybille's life and destiny than either of them could have imagined.Like a magician herself, Jeanne Kalogridis weaves a tale of star-crossed love, of faith and heresy, of mysticism and witchcraft, against a fascinating historical backdrop -- the Black Death, the Hundred Years' War, and the catastrophic defeat of France at the hands of the English.

Set primarily among the working class of a Seattle suburb called Federal Way, this highly original novel extols the lives of a large cast of characters lost in various modes of darkness and despair. Whether desperately alone or struggling to come together, they grapple with dark compulsions and heartrending afflictions. What binds them is the Well--that dark, barren Wasteland of the heart and mind--as if trapped at the bottom of well, they search for relief, for a vehicle into the light they know is up and outside. They search in sex, drugs, and violence, and in visions of apocalypse and creation, dreams of angels and killers and local sports championships. Compact, finely wrought, and powerfully charged, Well ultimately rises toward the light in a finale that echoes with the exhilarating human capacity for hope. The result is a mesmerizing tour de force that will establish Matthew McIntosh as a bold and progressive new voice of American fiction.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Literary Fiction", "Novels"], "author": "Matthew  McIntosh", "rating": "3.47", "pages": null}, {"id": 1837594, "title": "Le C\u0153ur du proph\u00e8te", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Bande Dessin\u00e9e", "Comics", "Graphic Novels"], "author": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Di Giorgio", "rating": "3.81", "pages": "46"}, {"id": 1837624, "title": "Haute surveillance", "blurb": "D\u00e9cor: une cellule de prison.

A literary icon praised by The New York Times Book Review as the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever, he has influenced many contemporary writers and is known for both the quality and the accessibility of his writing.In this collection of new and recently published short fiction, Leonard demonstrates the superb characterizations, dead-on dialogue, vivid atmosphere, and driving plotting that have made him a household name.

What place does morality have in the kind of life it makes most sense to lead? How are we to understand claims to objectivity in moral judgments and in judgments of rationality? When we find ourselves in fundamental disagreement with whole communities, how can we understand our disagreement and cope with it?To shed light on such issues, Allan Gibbard develops what he calls a norm-expressivistic analysis of rationality. He refines this analysis by drawing on evolutionary theory and experimental psychology, as well as on more traditional moral and political philosophy. What emerges is an interpretation of human normative life, with its quandaries and disputes over what is rational and irrational, morally right and morally wrong. Judgments of what it makes sense to do, to think, and to feel, Gibbard argues, are central to shaping the way we live our lives.Gibbard does not hesitate to take up a wide variety of possible difficulties for his analysis. This sensitivity to the true complexity of the subject matter gives his treatment a special richness and depth. The fundamental importance of the issues he addresses and the freshness and suggestiveness of the account he puts forward, along with his illuminating treatment of aspects of sociobiology theory, will ensure this book a warm reception from philosophers, social scientists, and others with a serious interest in the nature of human thought and action.", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Allan Gibbard", "rating": "3.56", "pages": "364"}, {"id": 1839401, "title": "La vuelta del tornillo", "blurb": "A striking story of ghosts.

Although writing for publication is becoming increasingly important as these fields become both more professional and more competitive, few scholars talk candidly about their experiences negotiating a piece of writing into print. These essays will help researchers, practitioners, and graduate students expand their understanding of what it means--professionally and personally--to write for publication.Carefully crafted, focused, and provocative, the chapters in this volume document authors' experiences with a range of practical, political, and personal issues in writing for publication. Many portray the hardship and struggle that are not obvious in a finished piece of writing. Readers are encouraged to resonate with the events and issues portrayed, and to connect the narratives to their own lives. Practical information, such as contact information for journal and book publishers, manuscript guidelines, and useful books are included in appendices.Although organized thematically, the essays in Writing for Scholarly Publication: Behind the Scenes in Language Education overlap in many ways as each author considers multiple issues:  *In the Introduction, the editors discuss key aspects of writing for scholarly publication, such as writing as situated practice, issues faced by newcomers, the construction of personal identity through writing, writing and transparency, facets of the interactive nature of scholarly writing, and intertwined political issues.  *Part I focuses on issues and concerns faced by Newcomers.  *In Part II, Negotiating and Interacting, the essays closely examine the interactions among authors, editors, manuscript reviewers, and collaborators; these interactions tend to be the least often discussed and these essays therefore offer readers fascinating insights into the sensitive social, political, and personal relationships among the many players in the scholarly writing game.  *Identity Construction is addressed in Part III, where authors share their experiences with and reflections on the ways that professional writing helps them construct their identities as writers and scholars.  *The essays in Part IV, From the Periphery, help redefine what the notion of periphery might mean, from a concept with a negative connotation of outsider to a positive connotation of active and unconventional participant.\n...more", "genre": ["Language", "Writing"], "author": "Christine Pearson Casanave", "rating": "3.80", "pages": "312"}, {"id": 1840819, "title": "The Illustrated Golden Bough", "blurb": "A obra cl\u00e1ssica de James G.

The pageantry and pretentious displays of excess were sufficient to cloy the senses of participants as well as to offend the sensitive. Petronius, a generous and noble Roman, a man of the world much in favor at the court of Nero, is intrigued by a strange tale related by his nephew Marcus Vinitius of his encounter with a mysterious young woman called Ligia with whom Vinitius falls madly in love. Ligia, a captured King's daughter and a one-time hostage of Rome, is now a foster child of a noble Roman household. She's also a Christian. The setting of the narrative was prepared with utmost care. Sienkiewicz visited the Roman locations many times and thoroughly educated himself in the novel's historical background. As an attempt to create the spirit of antiquity, the novel met with unanimous acclaim, earning Sienkiewicz the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1905.

The protagonist, Lawrence Miller, is himself an expat teaching gender studies at a small college located just outside New York City. He is a member of the sexual harassment committee which meets on a regular basis to walk that fine line between the sublime and the ridiculous of political correctness. Miller's well-ordered life starts to disintegrate one day when he takes a book from the shelf in his office to find that the bookmark has been moved several pages although, as far as he knows, nobody has visited his office. An easily explained lapse of memory perhaps, but Miller decides he will discuss it with the therapist he has been seeing in Manhattan since his wife left him. He is shocked as he approaches her office to see the therapist walking towards him, but she turns off towards Central Park before he can speak to her and he then loses sight of her. When he arrives at her office, however, she is waiting for him as usual and assures him that she has not left her office; in fact, she is always with another patient before Miller's appointment. So begins the disorientation of Lawrence Miller. He has his little obsessions, of course--he won't pick up the messages on his answering machine, for instance, in order to convince himself that while he was out his wife tried to call him. Still in love with her, he hopes that she will call and want to return to him. But this is just a game he plays, part of his very human nature. He is in no way the sort of man who is paranoid or imagines conspiracies, but the unexplained incidents seem to be increasing. Miller tries to rationalize what is happening, but he can't help thinking, nor can we, that he has become the target of somebody who wishes him harm. And when a series of murders takes place, Miller begins to suspect that he is being set up to take the blame for these murders by a devious and diabolical mind. Lawrence Miller struggles to loosen the hold his pursuers have on him, but the more he struggles the more he appears to be drowning.

Particularly interesting is the translation of a collection of letters from Charles Giesecke to his brother in Germany which provide insight into the business and familial concerns of a German merchant and farmer.This wealth of information illuminates previously neglected aspects of intercontinental migration in the nineteenth century.

You've got to be kidding . . . Part serious, part comic, these words reflect our ambivalence about aging in the twenty-first century. Is it a blessing or a curse? With refreshing candor and characteristic wit, best-selling author Lillian Rubin looks deeply into the issues of our graying nation, the triumph of our new longevity, and the pain, both emotional and physical, that lies right alongside it. Through thought-provoking interviews, research, and unflinching analysis of her own life experience, Dr. Rubin offers us a much-needed road map for the uncharted territory that lies ahead. In a country where 78 million baby boomers are moving into their sixties and economists worry that they are the monster at the door that will break the Social Security bank and trash the economy; where 40 percent of sixty-five-year-olds are in the sandwich generation, taking care of their parents while often still supporting their children; and where Americans eighty-five and older represent the fastest-growing segment of the population, we cannot afford to pretend that our expanded old age is just a walk on the sunny side of the street, that sixty is the new forty, eighty is the new sixty, or that we'll all live happily ever after.In this wide-ranging book, Dr. Rubin examines how the new longevity ricochets around our social and emotional lives, affecting us all, for good and ill, from adolescence into senescence. How, she asks, do sixty-somethings fill another twenty, thirty, or more years post retirement without a useful identity or obvious purpose? What happens to sex as we move through the decades after sixty? What happens to long-cherished friendships as life takes unexpected turns? What happens when, at seventy, instead of living the life of freedom we've dreamed about, we find ourselves having to take care of Mom and Dad? What happens to the inheritances boomers have come to expect when their parents routinely live into their eighties and beyond and the cost of their care soars?In tackling the subject of aging over a broad swath of the population, cutting across race, class, gender, and physical and cognitive ability, Lillian Rubin gives us a powerful and long-overdue reminder that all of us will be touched by the problems arising from our new longevity. Our best hope is to understand thoroughly the realities we face and to prepare-as individuals and as a society-for a long life from sixty on up.\n...more", "genre": ["Sociology", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Lillian B.

Flares of recognition do come, like mysterious flames, but these only signal that Yambo remembers something; they do not return that memory to him. It is like being handed a wrapped package, the contents of which he can only guess. Within the limitations of Yambo's handicap and quest, Eco creates wondrous variety, wringing surprise and delight from such shamelessly hackneyed plot twists as the discovery of a hidden room. Illustrated with the cartoons, sheet music covers, and book jackets that Yambo uncovers in his search, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana can be read as a love letter to literature, a layered excavation of an Italian boyhood of the 1940s, and a sly meditation on human consciousness. Both playful and reverent, it stands with The Name of the Rose and The Island of the Day Before as among Eco's most successful novels. --Regina Marler\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Literature", "European Literature", "Italian Literature", "Cultural", "Italy", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary", "Novels", "Writing", "Books About Books", "Mystery"], "author": "Umberto Eco", "rating": "3.37", "pages": null}, {"id": 1843301, "title": "Landscape into Art", "blurb": "Sir Kenneth Clark possesses a rare ability for conveying artistic enthusiasm to those who might never encounter his more learned studies and catalogues.

Using the metaphor of love and marriage, this intriguing book traces the evolution of the Disney World-Orlando relationship, an economic-development marriage, says the author, characterized by conflict and consensus, individuality and mutual dependency - just like a real marriage. But there is another side to the story. As the author shows, growth not only gives, it also takes away. Fueled by Disney's arrival, the tremendous growth in Orlando has created public expenditure needs, but not always matching tax resources. It has generated traffic congestion, public facility deficits, affordable housing shortages, and a low-wage economy. This situation is complicated further because of the special enticement granted to the Disney Co. for coming to Florida: their own private government - a sort of Vatican with Mouse ears - with powers and immunities that exceed Orlando's.--BOOK JACKET.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Cities", "Urban Planning", "Cities", "Urban Studies", "Travel", "Politics"], "author": "Richard E.

She had faced the loss of both her parents, given up a twenty-year relationship with alcohol, and, as she writes, I was wandering around in a haze of uncertainty, blinking up at the biggest questions: Who am I without parents and without alcohol? How to form attachments, and where to find comfort, in the face of such daunting vulnerability? An answer materialized in the most unlikely form: that of a dog. Eighteen months to the day after she quit drinking, Knapp stumbled upon an eight-week-old puppy at a local animal shelter, took her home, and named her Lucille. Now two years old, Lucille has become a central force in Knapp's life: In her, she writes, I have found solace, joy, a bridge to the world. Caroline Knapp has been celebrated as much for her fresh insight into emotional and psychological issues as she has been for her gifts as a writer. In Pack of Two, she brings the same perception and talent to bear on the rich, complicated terrain of human-animal relationships. In addition to mining her own experience with Lucille, Knapp speaks to a wide variety of dog people--from animal behaviorists and psychologists to other owners whose dogs have deeply affected their lives--about this emotionally complex, sometimes daunting, often profoundly healing alliance. Throughout, she explores the shift in canine roles from working partners to intimate companions and looks, too, at how this new kinship, this wordless bond, becomes a template for what we most desire ourselves.\n...more", "genre": ["Animals", "Dogs", "Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Animals", "Biography", "Biography Memoir", "Environment", "Nature", "Psychology", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Autobiography"], "author": "Caroline Knapp", "rating": "4.03", "pages": "272"}, {"id": 1843723, "title": "Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge", "blurb": "Based on the hit Sony PlayStation video game, Night Warriors follows the sometimes scary, sometimes comedic adventures of a cast of weird characters including vampire prince Demitri; catwoman Felicia, a six-foot-tall fur-covered humanoid; ghoulish Lord Raptor; and vampire hunter Donovan.", "genre": ["Manga"], "author": "Run Ishida", "rating": "3.23", "pages": "168"}, {"id": 1843756, "title": "Grand Inquests: The Historic Impeachments of Justice Samuel Chase and President Andrew Johnson", "blurb": "Chief Justice Rehnquist presents the dramatic account of two of the most important legal decisions ever rendered in the US.

Indeed, many wonder if Vermeer employed a camera obscura, a primitive form of camera, to enhance his realistic effects? In Vermeer's Camera, Philip Steadman traces the development of the camera obscura--first described by Leonaro da Vinci--weighs the arguments that scholars have made for and against Vermeer's use of the camera, and offers a fascinating examination of the paintings themselves and what they alone can tell us of Vermeer's technique. Vermeer left no record of his method and indeed we know almost nothing of the man nor of how he worked. But by a close and illuminating study of the paintings Steadman concludes that Vermeer did use the camera obscura and shows how the inherent defects in this primitive device enabled Vermeer to achieve some remarkable effects--the slight blurring of image, the absence of sharp lines, the peculiar illusion not of closeness but of distance in the domestic scenes. Steadman argues that the use of the camera also explains some previously unexplainable qualities of Vermeer's art, such as the absence of conventional drawing, the pattern of underpainting in areas of pure tone, the pervasive feeling of reticence that suffuses his canvases, and the almost magical sense that Vermeer is painting not objects but light itself.  Drawing on a wealth of Vermeer research and displaying an extraordinary sensitivity to the subtleties of the work itself, Philip Steadman offers in Vermeer's Camera a fresh perspective on some of the most enchanting paintings ever created.\n...more", "genre": ["Art", "Nonfiction", "History", "Art", "Art History", "Historical", "Art", "Photography"], "author": "Philip Steadman", "rating": "4.18", "pages": "232"}, {"id": 1844045, "title": "The Brazilian Cat", "blurb": "This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.

Tell us about the first time you met George Harrison.  Working as a model, I occasionally went for castings, mainly for television commercials. I went for an interview with one of the directors I had worked with in the past, and he cast me in his first movie, A Hard Day's Night, to play the part of a schoolgirl. When I first saw George on the set, I thought he was the best-looking man I'd ever seen. I was so surprised when he asked me out on a date at the end of my first day of filming.  Tell us about the first time you heard George Harrison's song, Something.  George said he had written a song for me, and he played it on the guitar at home without the words. Then when I heard the song after it had been recorded I couldn't believe how utterly beautiful it was. It was released on a single in October 1969, and I felt so thrilled and flattered.  Tell us about the first time you heard Eric Clapton's Layla.  Eric invited me to his band's flat one day and played a rough recording of Layla on a cassette recorder. I was sitting on a sofa and he on the floor as it played, and he kept looking up at me for a reaction. I was stunned; the intensity, passion and tenderness came across so strongly--I knew, as he said, it was written for me.  \n...more", "genre": ["Music", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Biography Memoir", "Music", "Rock N Roll", "History", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Culture", "Pop Culture"], "author": "Pattie Boyd", "rating": "3.69", "pages": null}, {"id": 1844476, "title": "Only Call Us Faithful: A Novel of the Union Underground", "blurb": "Elizabeth Van Lew, PatriotElizabeth Van Lew was born in Richmond, Virginia, a citizen of the United States of America.

He is a theoretical innovator whose ideas about the intersections of politics and culture have reshaped the critical landscape across the humanities and social sciences. Bringing together ten interviews conducted between 1982 and 2005, Jameson on Jameson is a compellingly candid introduction to his thought for those new to it, and a rich source of illumination and clarification for those seeking deeper understanding. Jameson discusses his intellectual and political preoccupations, most prominently his commitment to Marxism as a way of critiquing capitalism and the culture it has engendered. He explains many of his key concepts, including postmodernism, the dialectic, metacommentary, the political unconscious, the utopian, cognitive mapping, and spatialization.Jameson on Jameson displays Jameson\u2019s extraordinary grasp of contemporary culture\u2014architecture, art, cinema, literature, philosophy, politics, psychoanalysis, and urban geography\u2014as well as the challenge that the geographic reach of his thinking poses to the Eurocentricity of the West. Conducted by accomplished scholars from United States, Egypt, Korea, China, Sweden, and England, the interviews elicit Jameson\u2019s reflections on the broad international significance of his ideas and their applicability and implications in different cultural and political contexts, including the present phase of globalization.The volume includes an introduction by Jameson and a comprehensive bibliography of his publications in all languages.InterviewersMona Abousenna Abbas Al-TonsiSrinivas AravamudanJonathan CullerSara DaniusLeonard GreenSabry HafezStuart Hall Stefan JonssonRanjana KhannaRichard KleinHoracio MachinPaik Nak-chungMichael Speaks Anders StephansonXudong Zhang\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Philosophy"], "author": "Fredric Jameson", "rating": "3.85", "pages": "296"}, {"id": 1846253, "title": "For Sale by Owner in California", "blurb": "Using a broker to sell a home can cost up to six percent of the selling price - in other words, if a house sells for $400,000, sellers can lose up to $24,000.But they'll save that money if they sell the house themselves - and it's not hard to do!Thoroughly revised and scrupulously researched, For Sale By Owner in California takes readers step by step through the entire selling process, from putting the house on the market to transferring the title.

But, above all, as this book reminds us, he has been an influential artist. Known for his Happenings, Kaprow created vanguard performances in the early 1960s in which he collaged various art forms (painting, music, dance), disguised as ordinary things (newspaper, noise, body movement), into quasi-theatrical events. In the decades since, his works have remained open to the changing character of contemporary experience, always seeking the thresholds at which art and life converge. Because this art places such emphasis on direct experience, some people today think Kaprow's works were primarily transitory and immaterial. Childsplay corrects that misconception by providing a vivid description of Kaprow's Happenings and other art activities, clarifying their materiality, duration, and setting, as well as the ways in which people participated in them. Jeff Kelley brings the artist, his era, and his work to life by showing that Kaprow's artworks were physically present, socially engaged, and intellectually resonant in the moment of their enactment.\n...more", "genre": ["Art"], "author": "Jeff Kelley", "rating": "4.22", "pages": "274"}, {"id": 1846679, "title": "D\u00e9sir\u00e9e", "blurb": "The stunning, massively bestselling story of Napoleon's first fianc\u00e9\n First published in 1953, this riveting true-life tale comes to life in diary form, giving readers an inside glimpse at the young Napoleon and his family.

In the US all military pilots were needed for combat duty, which left critical piloting jobs vacant across the land. Who would deliver the newly manufactured planes to their domestic bases? Who would train new flight crews and tow targets for anti-aircraft practice, test new planes and retest old ones? The answer was: women. These elite pilots were the WASPs. Civilians all, they earned their wings so that they could undertake hazardous, and sometimes deadly, flight assignments. At the same time, these young women loved their work. They leapt at the chance to fly an array of fighter planes, and even the big B-29 bombers that scared off many men. They were an intrepid group whose service was as essential at the time as it was later overlooked. Adventurous in play as well as work, the WASPs got into, and out of, some hair-raising episodes. Wanda Langley has conducted extensive interviews with former WASPs, and has the insider's details of their escapades, as well as their training and service.Much of the story is seen in the life of Marie Michell, a nineteen-year-old WASP and fine pilot whose death in a crash underscores the dangers these women faced on a daily basis while doing what they did best to serve their country in war.", "genre": ["History", "Aviation", "Biography", "World War II", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Wanda Langley", "rating": "4.03", "pages": "132"}, {"id": 1846867, "title": "Our Stars", "blurb": "Scientists use telescopes and satellites to study the stars.

When Lt-Ge\nOn the 10th anniversary of when UN peacekeepers landed in Rwanda, Random House Canada proudly publishes the unforgettable 1st-hand account of the genocide by the leader of the mission. Digging deep into shattering memories, Dallaire has written a powerful story of betrayal, na\u00efvet\u00e9, racism & international politics. His message is simple, undeniable: Never again. When Lt-Gen. Rom\u00e9o Dallaire was called to serve as force commander of the UN intervention in Rwanda in '93, he thought he was heading off on a straightforward peacekeeping mission. Thirteen months later he flew home from Africa, broken, disillusioned & suicidal, having witnessed the slaughter of 800,000 Rwandans in 100 days. In Shake Hands with the Devil, he takes readers with him on a return voyage into hell, vividly recreating the events the international community turned its back on. This book is an unsparing eyewitness account of the failure by humanity to stop the genocide, despite timely warnings. Woven thru the story of this disastrous mission is his own journey from confident Cold Warrior, to devastated UN commander, to retired general engaged in a painful struggle to find a measure of peace, hope & reconciliation. This book is a personal account of his conversion from a man certain of his worth & secure in his assumptions to one conscious of his own weaknesses & failures & critical of the institutions he'd relied on. It might not sit easily with standard ideas of military leadership, but understanding what happened to him & his mission to Rwanda is crucial to understanding the moral minefields peacekeepers are forced to negotiate when we ask them to step into dirty wars. Excerpt: My story is not a strictly military account nor a clinical, academic study of the breakdown of Rwanda. It is not a simplistic indictment of the many failures of the UN as a force for peace in the world. It is not a story of heroes & villains, altho such a work could easily be written. This book is a cri de coeur for the slaughtered thousands, a tribute to the souls hacked apart by machetes because of their supposed difference from those who sought to hang on to power...This book is the account of a few humans who were entrusted with the role of helping others taste the fruits of peace. Instead, we watched as the devil took control of paradise on earth & fed on the blood of the people we were supposed to protect.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Cultural", "Africa", "Politics", "War", "Biography", "Eastern Africa", "Rwanda", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Cultural", "Canada", "War", "Military Fiction"], "author": "Rom\u00e9o Dallaire", "rating": "4.23", "pages": "684"}, {"id": 1846992, "title": "Grant Moves South", "blurb": "Part one of the classic Civil War study of General Ulysses S.

The region conjures up strong images to all of us, and nowhere has its extraordinary social and political history been so fully expressed than through these carefully selected texts and images that capture the Southern love of language, sense of place, and often tragic experiences. We share the vision and passion of the unique heritage of the South through the powerful voices of favorite writers from Thomas Jefferson, Margaret Mitchell, and Mark Twain, to William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Martin Luther King, Jr., Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, and Alex Haley. Visual artists capture the haunting environment in colorful, expressive drawings, etchings, watercolor and oil paintings, as well as remarkable folk art and stunning handicrafts. The illustrations in this magnificent collection range from Mississippian-period carved figures from the Etowah Mounds, Georgia, to a sixteenth-century map of Virginia and drawings of the Indian Village of Secoton, to historical portraits including John Trumbull's painting of George Washington and George Catlin's famous drawings of native Americans, to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scenes of plantation and town life, as well as haunting Civil War images. Depression-era photographs by Walker Evans and Marion Post Wolcott are included as are images by contemporary Southern photographers like William Eggleston and Sally Mann. Garcilaso de la Vega, Captain John Smith, and Mark Catesby capture the newcomers' enchantment with the lush opulence of the natural landscape.

En 1955 dirigi\u00f3 su primera pel\u00edcula, Generaci\u00f3n, y en 1962 pas\u00f3 a dirigir igualmente teatro.Un cine llamado deseo analiza paso a paso, desde la perspectiva que dan \u00abcasi treinta a\u00f1os\u00bb de experiencia profesional en el cine, las diversas etapas y elementos que, una vez realizados y reunidos, dan como resultado una pel\u00edcula: desde la idea que la hace surgir, hasta su edici\u00f3n final y, como colof\u00f3n, el \u00abtriste d\u00eda del estreno\u00bb. Pudo haberse llamado tambi\u00e9n Cartas a un joven cineasta, pero Wajda prefiri\u00f3 dedic\u00e1rselo a s\u00ed mismo o, m\u00e1s bien, al \u00abjoven incre\u00edblemente inocente\u00bb que, seg\u00fan confesi\u00f3n propia, era en 1949, cuando dej\u00f3 la pintura para dedicarse al cine.Se trata entonces de un prontuario, y no hay nada que sea relevante para un director de cine (para un cineasta en general), que no est\u00e9 delimitado y desglosado en el libro de Wajda. Los ejemplos y los detalles son m\u00ednimos, pero suficientes e intencionados, quiz\u00e1 porque no hay muestra m\u00e1s clara de la experiencia adquirida que la econom\u00eda en la exposici\u00f3n y en las conclusiones. Redactado en primera persona y escrito para s\u00ed, era inevitable que el libro delatara a su autor: su humor, su inteligencia, sus buenas maneras, sus limitaciones, tropiezos, errores, a\u00f1oranzas y lealtades, van de la mano (de manera ligera, precisa y grata) con la enorme experiencia que Wajda adquiri\u00f3 como cineasta y cuyo mejor testimonio son sus propias pel\u00edculas.Recipiente de numerosos premios y t\u00edtulos honor\u00edficos, Wajda y su carrera art\u00edstica han sido ampliamente reconocidos en su patria y en el extranjero. Toca al lector ahora entrar en contacto con aquellas otras cualidades suyas, las m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicas, las m\u00e1s humanas, que lo hicieron el gran artista que ha sido y que no se suelen premiar, pero surgen en cada p\u00e1gina de este libro lleno de sapiencia y bonhom\u00eda.Un cine llamado deseo es el recorrido puntual de uno de los realizadores m\u00e1s importantes de la cinematograf\u00eda universal desde 1949, cuan-do a sus 24 a\u00f1os interrumpe sus estudios de pintura, hasta 1983, a\u00f1o en el que filma Danton y Un amor en Alemania. Andrzej Wajda realiz\u00f3 algunos cortometrajes en la Escuela Superior de Cine de Lodz e inici\u00f3, en 1955, su carrera profesional con Generaci\u00f3n, a la que siguieron, entre otras, Canal (1957), Cenizas y diamantes (1958, adaptaci\u00f3n de la novela hom\u00f3nima de Jerzy Andrzejewski), Brujos inocentes (1960), Cenizas (1965), Las puertas del para\u00edso (1968, otra adaptaci\u00f3n de Andrzejewski), Todo en venta (1969), Los abedules (1970, adaptaci\u00f3n de otro destacado escritor polaco contempor\u00e1neo, Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz, y por la cual obtuviera su primer premio internacional, en el Festival de Mosc\u00fa, luego de obtener varias nominaciones en diversos festivales), Paisaje despu\u00e9s de la batalla (1970), La tierra de la gran promesa (1974, de nuevo una adaptaci\u00f3n de un escritor polaco, Stanislaw W. Reymont, Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1924), L\u00ednea de sombra (1976, basada en la obra del escritor anglopolaco Joseph Conrad), El hombre de m\u00e1rmol (1977, premiada por la FIPRESCI en Cannes), Las se\u00f1ori-tas de Wilko (1979, de nuevo de la mano de Jaroslaw Iwaszkiewicz), El director de orquesta (1979, premiada en Berl\u00edn), y El hombre de hierro (1981, por la que recibi\u00f3 la Palma de Oro en Cannes).Un cine llamado deseo es tambi\u00e9n el recorrido que toda pel\u00edcula lleva en su construcci\u00f3n, desde la idea hasta el estreno, pasando por los diversos obst\u00e1culos de la producci\u00f3n e, incluso, de la censura. Su planteamiento observa al arte cinematogr\u00e1fico como una obra de autor inserto en su propio sentido nacional, independientemente, o a pesar, del Estado. Tras la desaparici\u00f3n forzada de su Unidad de Producci\u00f3n Zesp\u00f3l \u201cX\u201d, Wajda se mantuvo incansable y productivo, tanto como director de teatro \u2014con m\u00e1s de veinte puestas en escena\u2014 como de cine, seg\u00fan muestra la filmograf\u00eda que hace las veces de ap\u00e9ndice a esta edici\u00f3n, en la que destacan, luego de la publicaci\u00f3n original de esta obra: Los pose\u00eddos (1988), Crimen y castigo (1992), Nastasia (1994), todas ellas basadas en Dostoievski, as\u00ed como Semana Santa (1995), Pan Tedeusz (1999), el segmento El hombre de la esperanza, sobre Lech Walesa, que forma parte de Solidaridad, Solidaridad\u2026 (2005).

Intimate Marriage Bible studies bring spouses into deeper communion with God and with each other. In marriage a man and a woman are called to leave their families of origin, to weave their individual lives into a unity and to cleave to each other. How can fallen human beings even begin to contemplate this ideal--God's ideal?

Away from her parents and surrounded by trees, space, and students whose problems she can't completely comprehend, Mia has no choice but to learn about herself.With insight and sympathy, Nora Raleigh Baskin focuses on the universal feeling of being a misfit, showing that sometimes the path home is as unexpected as it is challenging.\n...more", "genre": ["Realistic Fiction", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Young Adult", "Teen", "Contemporary", "Childrens", "School Stories"], "author": "Nora Raleigh Baskin", "rating": "3.22", "pages": "170"}, {"id": 1847187, "title": "The Street Lawyer", "blurb": "Michael was in a hurry.

SELDOM does a whole city or society disappear without a trace. Yet this is what happened to four towns or cities (Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim) on the plains of Siddim around 1900-2000 B.C. The best-known of these sister cities was Sodom. We have some information in the scriptures about what happened, but even less information in secular records. Significantly, Jesus Christ confirmed both the existence and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah during his earthly ministry. One can imagine the tremendous curiosity and excitement, therefore, that any additional information about the reasons for the destruction of this cluster of sister cities would create. There are, of course, no Sodom Scrolls to supply such information. But... Suppose someone like Eliezer, Abraham's steward, had kept his cumulative impressions of Sodom on several scrolls. Suppose Elieser finally gave his scrolls to Lot for review, since Lot was, after all, the one whose experience was so firsthand. Suppose the scrolls were left in Lot's cave in the mountains near Zoar (the one little town of the five that God spared), for Lot dwelt in a cave in the mountains up out of Zoar. No doubt, if such scrolls were later found, they would be known as The Sodom Scrolls, and they might well contain such things as are on the speculative pages in the fictional revisitation to follow. These fictitious scrolls and their content do take advantage of what we know about Sodom from the scriptures and from secular sources, modest as the amount of that information is. Efforts have been made in the style to blend in relevant quotations from scriptures that obviously emerged after Elieser's time; the scriptures so used either pertain to Sodom or involve timeless truths about human nature that are descriptive of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come. (Both scriptural and secular sources in the scrolls are noted sequentially at the end of each scroll. Quotation marks and numbers are omitted to ease the passage of the eye. Those scriptural quotations with which Eliezer would have a personal familiarity are in quotation marks, however.) Most importantly, the style of writing used assumes that Eliezer was a tutored steward and no ordinary helping hand around Abraham's household, for the brilliant and spiritual Abraham would need a fairly sophisticated steward. Any steward of Abraham with any kind of tenure would have had a most unusual life with many chances to see and observe many things. The reader's understanding and patience are especially needed, however, as Elieser becomes the eyes, ears, and voice of this fictional revisitation of Sodom using scriptures and supposings. The Savior has warned that his second coming will occur (1) just as did the flood in Noah's time and also (2) as the raining of fire and brimstone on Sodom-as a surprise (except to the very faithful). We would do well, therefore, to ponder the lessons of the past as well as the possible parallels between our own society and the society of Sodom, for Sodom was not just a place, but a way of life. Many today are as indecisive about the evils emerging around us-are as reluctant to renounce fully a wrong way of life-as was Lot's wife. Perhaps in this respect, as well as in the indicators of corruption of which sexual immorality is but one indicator, our present parallels are most poignant and disturbing. It was Jesus himself who said, Remember Lot's wife. Indeed we should-and remember too all that the Savior implied with those three powerful words.\n...more", "genre": ["Christianity", "Lds", "Religion"], "author": "Neal A.

Since our chakras are focal points where physical, emotional, developmental, and spiritual forces intersect, they provide a paradigm that usefully links physical, psychological, developmental, and spiritual dimensions.

The present work is a painstaking and thorough-going analysis of the travails of the Aguinaldo government during the war with the United States. Agoncillo, in an impressive display of historical technique, gives the reader the struggles within the Philippine Revolutionary Government. He expands on the theme of his previous book, namely the conflict between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots', and brings into full play the economic as well as the social motivations of the parties concerned. Sparing no one, Agoncillo, with the historian's impartiality, unmasks the selfish ilustrado class in their attempts at compromise which ultimately weakened Aguinaldo's hand. After reading his chapters on the crucial period of the Malolos Republic, one gains a new attitude towards men like Paterno, Pardo de Tavera, Buencamino, Legarda, Araneta and others, whom history has hitherto presented as heroes. The well-documented account of the extended negotiations between the Americans and Aguinaldo is one of the high points of the book. The author brings into sharp relief certain American maneuvers which other historians have glossed over or chosen to overlook. In the author's skillful hands, historical events come to life. Without sacrificing impartiality, he is able to write with vigor and vividness. This is not an anemic account of the past. Events are not presented merely as so many beads strung together haphazardly on the thread of time. Agoncillo has sought to write a history which will answer more than just the who, what, when, and where of our past. He has studied the why behind major events and consequently has presented a meaningful account of one of the most important periods of Philippine history. This voluminous work is the result of months of serious study here and abroad. In writing The Revolt of the Masses..., the author complained of lack of materials; for the present volume, he had to wade through a plethora of sources. It is an achievement of the author to have mastered so unwieldy a period with its abundance of documents and materials. Teodoro A. Agoncillo is professor of history in the state university. He is noted not only as a historian, but also as a writer in Tagalog. Before he joined the University of the Philippines in 1958, he occupied high positions in the Institute of National Language and in the Philippine Information Agency. His book, The Revolt of the Masses (1956) won the Republic Prize in 1948.\n...more", "genre": ["History"], "author": "Teodoro A.

Much of the play celebrates the traditional warrior ethic from the Trojan War and earlier, but it also contrasts this with a more civic-minded concern for the safety of the entire polis, rather than for the glory that comes with heroic individuality in theface of danger.Central to the play is the character of Eteocles, who, as king of Thebes, is responsible for the well being of the city but who, as a son of Oedipus, is obsessed by the nature of the curse upon his family and the need to assert his own heroic qualities, even though that will bring about his death and continue the series of disasters which have afflicted Thebes since the days of Laius and Jocasta, the parents of Oedipus.The play is remarkable for the formal patterning of the speeches, the moving quality of its lyrics, and the sense it conveys of human life lived out under the watchful and ominous scrutiny of the divine forces which rule the world.\n...more", "genre": ["Plays", "Classics", "Drama", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Mythology", "Plays", "Theatre", "Tragedy", "Literature", "Ancient", "Poetry", "Literature"], "author": "Aeschylus", "rating": "3.72", "pages": "80"}, {"id": 1849441, "title": "Mr Twiddle Stories", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Fiction"], "author": "Enid Blyton", "rating": "4.40", "pages": "Paperback"}, {"id": 1849527, "title": "Lifekeys Discovery Workbook: Discovering Who You Are, Why You're Here, and What You Do Best", "blurb": "Takes the unique, integrated method of the LifeKeys book and puts the exercises into a convenient workbook form.", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Christian", "Self Help", "Reference"], "author": "Jane A.G.

Gordon becomes convinced that ghosts and other weird entities inhabit a daimonic reality that can interact with our everyday world. He starts seeing mystery and danger everywhere in his isolated farming community. He even thinks his best friend, Jimmy, might be possessed by demons.... June 7th, 1979: Reality catches up with Gordon's worst imaginings on the day after his thirteenth birthday, when his father dies by crashing a Cessna into the living room of their house. Gordon sets out to discover whether the plane crash was an accident or something far more sinister. Before he finds the answer, he'll experience puberty, Pink Floyd, trout fishing, lesbian vampire movies, and midnight cliff-diving with the Hell's Angels--all while learning to cope with the trauma-induced narcolepsy that inspires his nickname, Crash Gordon.... Halloween, 1982: Gordon meets Jimmy's Uncle Lloyd, an obscenely rich insurance broker to the rocket industry who makes Woodward and Bernstein's Deep Throat look like a low-level bureaucrat. With Lloyd acting as their demented mentor, Gordon and his friends embark on a road trip to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. Along the way, Lloyd lectures them about such diverse topics as hypnotism, assassination theories, MK-ULTRA, COINTELPRO, and the kidnapping of Patty Hearst; serial killers, satanic sacrifices, interdimensional energy portals, and the remote viewing program at the Stanford Research Institute; shamanism, ayahuasca, Terence McKenna's tryptamine-fueled encounters with the Logos, and the role future causality plays in the world's current fate. And that's only a prelude to Lloyd's startling explanation of how Gordon and Jimmy have become unwitting participants in a CIA mind control experiment known as Project MONARCH....\n...more", "genre": ["Mystery", "Fiction"], "author": "Derek Swannson", "rating": "3.93", "pages": "616"}, {"id": 1849834, "title": "Pieces", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Poetry"], "author": "Francis Ponge", "rating": "3.31", "pages": "194"}, {"id": 1849843, "title": "The Legends of the Jews: From Joshua to Esther", "blurb": "The first books of the Bible describe powerfully but briefly the creation, the first generations of humanity, and the early history of the Jews.

Running to Paradise describes Yeats's whole effort--sometimes leavened by wild humor--to convey, with high poetic integrity, his passionate sense of his own life and of his chaotic era. Himself a noted poet, Rosenthal stresses Yeats's artistry and psychological candor. The book ranges from his early exquisite lyrical poems and folklore-rooted plays, through the tougher-minded, more confessional mature work (including the sublime achievement of The Tower), and then to the sometimes mad yet often brilliant tragic or comic writing of his last years. Quoting extensively from Yeats, Rosenthal charts the gathering force with which the poet confronted his major life-issues: his art's demands, his persistent but hopeless love for one woman, the complexities of marriage to another woman at age 52, and his distress during Ireland's Troubles.

Decades later, spurred by the discovery of a cache of desperate letters written to his grandfather in 1939 and tantalized by fragmentary tales of a terrible betrayal, Daniel Mendelsohn sets out to find the remaining eyewitnesses to his relatives' fates. That quest eventually takes him to a dozen countries on four continents and forces him to confront the wrenching discrepancies between the histories we live and the stories we tell. And it leads him, finally, back to the small Ukrainian town where his family's story began, and where the solution to a decades-old mystery awaits him.Deftly moving between past and present, interweaving a world-wandering odyssey with childhood memories of a now-lost generation of immigrant Jews and provocative ruminations on biblical texts and Jewish history, The Lost transforms the story of one family into a profound, morally searching meditation on our fragile hold on the past.

Cleaning up the afterlife ? one spirit at a time!Hot-tempered 15-year-old Ichigo Kurosaki, the hero of the popular fantasy-adventure Bleach, has the unsettling ability to see spirits who are unable to rest in peace. His sixth sense leads him to Rukia, a Soul Reaper who destroys Hollows (soul-devouring monsters) and ensures the deceased find repose with the Soul Society. When she's injured in battle, Rukia transfers her sword and much of her power to Ichigo, whose spiritual energy makes him a formidable substitute Soul Reaper.

Getting involved with any woman, much less one who might ultimately drive a wedge between him and Benito, is the last thing Dante needs, especially now, when his life is already in turmoil. The wealthy, influential family of a murder suspect he killed in the line of duty is portraying him as a trigger-happy vigilante, putting his career and reputation on the line.

Eliot's. Now Charles Cross has cracked the code in the definitive biography Heavier Than Heaven, an all-access pass to Cobain's heart and mind. It reveals many secrets, thanks to 400-plus interviews, and even quotes Cobain's diaries and suicide notes and reveals an unreleased Nirvana masterpiece. At last we know how he created, how lies helped him die, how his family and love life entwined his art--plus, what the heck Smells Like Teen Spirit really means. (It was graffiti by Bikini Kill's Kathleen Hanna after a double date with Dave Grohl, Cobain, and the over-bored and self-assured Tobi Vail, who wore Teen Spirit perfume; Hanna wrote it to taunt the emotionally clingy Cobain for wearing Vail's scent after sex--a violation of the no-strings-attached dating ethos of the Olympia, Washington, outcast teen underground. Cobain's stomach-churning passion for Vail erupted in six or so hit tunes like Aneurysm and Drain You.)  Cross uncovers plenty of news, mostly grim and gripping. As a teen, Cobain said he had suicide genes, and his clan was peculiarly defiant: one of his suicidal relatives stabbed his own belly in front of his family, then ripped apart the wound in the hospital. Cobain was contradictory: a sweet, popular teen athlete and sinister berserker, a kid who rescued injured pigeons and laughingly killed a cat, a talented yet astoundingly morbid visual artist. He grew up to be a millionaire who slept in cars (and stole one), a fiercely loyal man who ruthlessly screwed his oldest, best friends. In fact, his essence was contradictions barely contained. Cross, the coauthor of Nevermind: Nirvana, the definitive book about the making of the classic album, puts numerous Cobain-generated myths to rest. (Cobain never lived under a bridge--that Aberdeen bridge immortalized in the 12th song on Nevermind was a tidal slough, so nobody could sleep under it.) He gives the fullest account yet of what it was like to be, or love, Kurt Cobain. Heavier Than Heaven outshines the also indispensable Come As You Are.

Working with his friend Luis Spota, the editor of the cultural section of the newspaper El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico, Jodo initially planned 3 months\u2019 worth of weekly comics, which he would draw himself. However, his \u201cPanic Fables\u201d--named after his early \u201860s avant-garde theater movement in Paris--were met with such insatiable popularity that he continued the series for six and a half years, from June 1967 until December 1973.Appearing for the first time in English, this book presents all 284 of Jodorowsky\u2019s Panic Fables in full color, along with an introduction by the author. He reveals how his first comics reflected his pessimism about the future and the meaning of life, the negativity of which soon exhausted him. He realized he needed to show the positivity that he encountered in life, and thus, little by little, he began incorporating Zen teachings, initiatory wisdom, and sacred symbology into his Panic Fables. Through this transformation and the outpouring of support from his devoted readers, many of whom cite the Panic Fables as providing pivotal guidance during their adolescence, Jodo discovered that art can serve to heal as well as raise consciousness.Writing himself into his comics, Jodo can be glimpsed as the character of the disciple who talks with his master and, as the series progresses, gradually grows to assume the role of master, providing psychomagic solutions to the problems of everyday life. In reading the complete Panic Fables in chronological order, much like his film The Dance of Reality, we witness in colorful detail Jodorowsky\u2019s own path of spiritual growth.\n...more", "genre": ["Sequential Art", "Comics", "Sequential Art", "Graphic Novels", "Philosophy", "Religion", "Art", "Psychology"], "author": "Alejandro Jodorowsky", "rating": "4.26", "pages": "302"}, {"id": 1856702, "title": "The Geezer Factory Murders", "blurb": "In the seventh book in this popular series, irrepressible amateur sleuths Angela Benbow and Caledonia Wingate find their plush retirement home, Camden-sur-Mer, is absorbing tenants from a rival establishment, The Golden Years, which the heroines have dubbed The Geezer Factory.

Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife, Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden.  As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy. But despite its many languorous pleasures, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Horror", "Fantasy", "Gothic", "Literature", "Novels", "Literature", "19th Century", "LGBT", "Classics", "Classic Literature"], "author": "Oscar Wilde", "rating": "4.11", "pages": "224"}, {"id": 1857465, "title": "Master Checkmate Strategy", "blurb": "This text covers all the basic combinations, plus advanced, surprising and unconventional mates.

The topic of forgiveness is fast becoming one of the key concepts in psychotherapy. Until now, explains Spring, we have bought into the myth that forgiving is not only good for you but is the only morally sound response to violation. We believe that there are only two choices, to forgive or not, and that forgiveness is an unconditional gift that does not have to be earned by the offender. In How Can I Forgive You?, Spring debunks these myths and offers a new way to think about this critical dynamic\u2013\u2013illuminating a middle ground between total forgiveness and not forgiving, an approach that enables the hurt party to maintain self\u2013respect and get on with their lives...After years of observing people first hand in her clinical practice and witnessing their struggle to forgive and be forgiven, Spring has developed a model to help real people heal from real interpersonal injuries. She provides concrete, detailed, step\u2013by stop instructions for both the hurt party and the offender. Spring explains that there are many options. You can refuse to forgive, which is empowering but leaves you stewing. You can offer cheap forgiveness, which happens when you ignore your pain and will do anything to preserve the relationship. Or you can take the healthier paths of acceptance and genuine forgiveness. In Acceptance, you cut your own path and walk alone. In Genuine Forgiveness, the offender clears a path and walks beside you.The clinical examples run from the petty to the serious to the profane \u2013 from a friend who forgets your birthday to a brother who refuses to help you take care of an elderly parent to a deliberate act of sexual abuse.We are all struggling to forgive someone, and hate feeling ruptured in our significant relationships and fractured within ourselves. We are all searching for some new position that frees us from the corrosive effects of hate, gives voice to the injustice, and helps us to make peace with the person who hurt us and with ourselves.

In Ehud\u2019s Dagger, James Holstun reconstructs their radical projects and calls for a return to and development of marxist history from below.He begins with a powerful critique of those anti-communist historians and literary critics who have tried to ignore or deny the role of working people in shaping the English Revolution. Then, drawing on Ernst Bloch\u2019s utopian marxism, Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s analysis of practical ensembles, and the political marxism of the British marxist historians, he begins his reconstruction of five seventeenth-century radical projects.In a Caroline prologue, he examines the political and poetic furor surrounding John Felton, who assassinated the Duke of Buckingham in 1628, enabling anonymous writers, readers and circulators of verse libels to contemplate a republican alternative to Charles\u2019s attempted absolutism. He then turns to the Revolution proper, focusing on the common soldiers of the Puritan New Model Army, who formed a military soviet in the summer of 1647 and bested their capitalist officers in debate; the Fifth Monarchist visionary Anna Trapnel, who wrote, preached, and prophesied publicly against the Protectorate on behalf of sectarian small producers; the Leveller theorist and desperado Edward Sexby, who wrote the brilliant republican treatise Killing Noe Murder and attempted to assassinate Oliver Cromwell; and the agrarian communist Diggers of Surrey, whose comrade and leader Gerrard Winstanley was the foremost social theorist of seventeenth-century England.Richly detailed and rigorously argued, Ehud\u2019s Dagger will spark renewed historical and literary critical interest in the prophetic writing, political struggle, and creative practical consciousness of working people in the early modern world.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History"], "author": "James Holstun", "rating": "4.70", "pages": "464"}, {"id": 1860217, "title": "Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska", "blurb": "Glacier Bay, located in southeast Alaska, is the world's largest protected marine sanctuary containing over 3 million acres.

After witnessing firsthand the devastating consequences of AIDS on the population, especially the children, the couple started volunteering at an orphanage that was desperately underfunded and short-staffed. One afternoon, a critically ill infant was brought to the orphanage from a village outside the city. She\u2019d been left to die in a field on the day she was born, abandoned in the tall brown grass that covers the highlands of Zimbabwe in the dry season. After a near-death hospital stay, and under strict doctor\u2019s orders, the ailing child was entrusted to the care of Tucker and Vita. Within weeks Chipo, the girl-child whose name means gift, would come to mean everything to them. Still an active correspondent, Tucker crisscrossed the continent, filing stories about the uprisings in the Congo, the civil war in Sierra Leone, and the postgenocidal conflict in Rwanda. He witnessed heartbreaking scenes of devastation and violence, steeling him further to take a personal role in helping anywhere he could. At home in Harare, Vita was nursing Chipo back to health. Soon she and Tucker decided to alter their lives forever\u2014they would adopt Chipo. That decision challenged an unspoken social norm\u2014that foreigners should never adopt Zimbabwean children. Raised in rural Mississippi in the sixties and seventies, Tucker was familiar with the mores associated with and dictated by race. His wife, a savvy black woman whose father escaped the Jim Crow South for a new life in the industrial North, would not be deterred in her resolve to welcome Chipo into their loving family. As if their situation wasn\u2019t tenuous enough, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was stirring up national fervor against foreigners, especially journalists, abroad and at home. At its peak, his antagonizing branded all foreign journalists personae non grata. For Tucker, the only full-time American correspondent in Zimbabwe, the declaration was a direct threat to his life and his wife\u2019s safety, and an ultimatum to their decision to adopt the child who had already become their only daughter. Against a background of war, terrorism, disease, and unbearable uncertainty about the future, Chipo\u2019s story emerges as an inspiring testament to the miracles that love\u2014and dogged determination\u2014can sometimes achieve. Gripping, heartbreaking, and triumphant, this family memoir will resonate throughout the ages.From the Hardcover edition.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Africa", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Parenting", "Adoption", "Eastern Africa", "Zimbabwe", "Biography", "Biography Memoir", "Audiobook", "Family", "Book Club"], "author": "Neely Tucker", "rating": "4.05", "pages": "256"}, {"id": 1860358, "title": "Out of Order", "blurb": "Baseball.

If these aren't troubles enough, Prince Tristan has an active, deadly enemy he doesn't even know exists: a trained wizard who is, astonishingly, even more powerful than the Chosen One. The hidden wizard has an intimate connection to Tristan that the prince could never have imagined.

First introduced in the spine-chilling novel The Bone Collector, Lincoln Rhyme dazzled readers with unparalleled forensic sleuthing -- all done from the confines of a wheelchair. A famed criminologist, paralyzed from the neck down, Rhyme compensates for his physical disability with his brains -- and the arms and legs of his brilliant and beautiful prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Amelia Sachs. It is Amelia who walks the grid for Rhyme, acting as his eyes and ears for the famously dangerous and difficult cases chronicled in Jeffery Deaver's bestselling novels The Bone Collector, The Coffin Dancer, and The Empty Chair.Now the awe-inspiring duo returns in The Stone Monkey. Recruited to help the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service perform the nearly impossible, Lincoln and Amelia manage to track down a cargo ship headed for New York City and carrying two dozen illegal Chinese immigrants, as well as the notorious human smuggler and killer known as the Ghost. But when the Ghost's capture goes disastrously wrong, Lincoln and Amelia find themselves in a race against time: to stop the Ghost before he can track down and murder the two surviving families who have escaped from the ship and vanished deep into the labyrinthine world of New York City's Chinatown.Over the next harrowing forty-eight hours, the Ghost brilliantly and ruthlessly hunts for the families, while Rhyme, aided by a quirky policeman from mainland China, struggles to find them before they die, and Amelia Sachs pursues a very different kind of police work -- forming a connection with one of the immigrants that may have consequences going to the core of her relationship with her partner and lover, Lincoln Rhyme.The Stone Monkey abounds with Deaver's famous trademarks: wholly unexpected plot twists, breakneck pacing, and characters who are heartbreakingly real, reminding us once again why People hailed him as the master of ticking-bomb suspense and Publishers Weekly called him the most clever plotter on the planet.", "genre": ["Mystery", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Crime", "Mystery Thriller", "Suspense", "Detective"], "author": "Jeffery Deaver", "rating": "3.96", "pages": "432"}, {"id": 1862830, "title": "Berthe Morisot", "blurb": "Of the six Impressionist painters whose first exhibition scandalized and fascinated Paris in 1874, Berthe Morisot was the only woman.

How they found the little home of their dreams and how they stumble upon the solution of a robbery that has been puzzling the countryside is lots of fun. There's entertainment in the description of Susan's ride to Philadelphia on one of those devilish new contraptions, the railroad train, which belched forth smoke and set fire to the passengers' clothes, and there's an unusual touch in her job of coloring the plates for the fashion magazine of the day, Godey's Lady's Book.", "genre": ["Fiction"], "author": "Virginia Frances Voight", "rating": "4.55", "pages": "hardcover"}, {"id": 1864413, "title": "Butcher", "blurb": "This 'private' investigation leads DS Lou Perlman into some places he could never have anticipated - into illegal surgical operations, and finding corpses whose bodies have been stripped of their organs and dumped.

Handling such an unwieldy amount of data is formidable and complex. Until now, working with these writing systems was an unattainable task to most, but this book clarifies the issues, even to those who don't understand East Asian languages.This new book contains revised information from Ken Lunde's first book, Understanding Japanese Information Processing, and supplements each chapter with meticulous details about how the Chinese (hanzi), Japanese (kana and kanji), Korean (hangul and hanja), and Vietnamese (Quoc ngu, chu Nom, and chu Han) writing systems have been implemented on contemporary computer systems. This book is unique in that it does not simply rattle off information that can be found in other sources, but rather it provides the reader with hitherto unexplained insights into how these complex writing systems have been adapted for use on computers, and provides the user and developer alike with useful and time-saving tips and techniques.Information on today's hot topics, such as how these writing systems impact contemporary Internet resources like the Web, HTML, XML, Java, and Adobe Acrobat, is also provided.This book is of incalculable value for the developer, programmer, user, and researcher -- anyone who comes into contact with these characters in the context of computers or the Internet needs this book. Topics covered in this book include:Writing systems Character set standards Encoding methods Input methods Font formats Typography Output methods Programming and code conversion techniques Dictionaries and dictionary software This volume also contains a host of valuable appendixes, such as code conversion tables, character set tables, character set indexes, mapping tables, Perl code examples, a glossary, and a detailed bibliography.", "genre": ["Computer Science", "Reference", "Japan", "Japanese Literature"], "author": "Ken Lunde", "rating": "3.79", "pages": "1125"}, {"id": 1864457, "title": "\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0646\u06cc", "blurb": "My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie.

Hailed by critics in both the UK and US as a one of the greatest rock stories ever told, it traces with deadly accuracy Moon's remarkable journey from his working-class Northwest London childhood, through the Who's glory years to the California high-life and a sad, premature death.In researching a life now distorted by myths of debauchery and comic anarchy, author Tony Fletcher interviewed over 120 of Moon\u2019s friends, family and associates. The result is a searingly personal portrait of a totally incorrigible yet uniquely generous boy who never grew up, and who changed the lives of all who knew him.In this astonishing biography, Tony Fletcher questions the myths, avoids the time-honoured anecdotes and talks afresh to those who where closest to Moon, including Kim, his wife of eight years, Linda, his sister, and Annette Walter-Lax, his main girlfriend during his final years. Also interviewed are Oliver Reed, Larry Hagman, David Putnam, Alice Cooper, Dave Edmunds, Jeff Beck, John Entwistle and many others who worked and partied with Moon. Fletcher reveals for the first time the truth behind the 'famous' stunts that never occurred \u2013 and the more outrageous ones that did! He also uncovers extraordinary details about Moon's outrageous extravagance which was financed by The Who's American success.This most recent edition of Dear Boy includes a newly-written afterword that considers Moon's lasting legacy, the death of John Entwistle and the Who's ongoing career in the new millennium. At over 300,00 words long Dear Boy is an acclaimed benchmark in rock biography, with over 200,000 copies now sold in various editions throughout the world.Illustrated with many photos from personal and Who archives.

The comics were revived in 2005 by Drawn & Quarterly and published as a hardcover series, sparking an international resurgence of the strip and recognition of Tove Jansson as one of the great twentieth-century cartoonists.

Tolvanen explains how Jansson came to publish her comic in England, why she eventually quit working on the strip, and how her brother Lars came to replace her as author and illustrator without any previous artistic experience. Moomin Every Day is accessible to Moomin novices and longtime readers of the Jansson stories alike.

Jakobson's contributions have now become a permanent part of American and European views on language. With his uncanny ability to survive devastating uprooting again and again--from Moscow to Prague to Upsalla to New York and finally to Cambridge--Jakobson was able to bring to each milieu new and stimulating ideas, which have broadened the perspective of linguistics while giving it new direction and specifying its domain. Linda Waugh and Monique Monville-Burston have assembled an intellectual overview of his work in linguistics from partial and complete works that they have arranged, introduced, and cross-referenced. Some appear here in print for the first time, others are newly translated into English. More than a convenient access to Jakobson's basic works, On Language presents a broad profile of the polymathic general linguist who suggested radical innovations in every area of linguistic theory. The breadth of Jakobson's engagement in linguistics is captured by the editors' informative introduction and by their perspicacious presentation of topics. His general view of the science of linguistics is followed by his stunning contributions to linguistic metatheory in the areas of structure and function. Various aspects of historical, typological, and sociolinguistics are also explored along with his phonological theory--perhaps his most influential contribution--and his views on grammatical semantics. A topic that increasingly preoccupied Jakobson in his later career, the interrelationship between sound and meaning, is presented here in detail. The concluding three essaysfocus on the various relations between linguistics and the human and natural sciences, which led Jakobson ultimately to be characterized as an interdisciplinary thinker.\n...more", "genre": ["Humanities", "Linguistics", "Humanities", "Language", "Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "Linguistics", "Semiotics", "Philosophy", "Theory", "Literature"], "author": "Roman Jakobson", "rating": "4.32", "pages": "646"}, {"id": 1865828, "title": "Six Lectures on Sound & Meaning", "blurb": "Preface by C.

The man hailed by Cornel West as the greatest pro-Africa freedom fighter of his generation in America makes a striking departure, figuratively and literally: He leaves America for a life in the Caribbean.  Randall Robinson is quitting America, and this book charts his journey from the most powerful nation on earth to the tiny tropical island where his wife was born. His search for a more peaceful and hospitable place grew out of the disappointment and increasing sense of abandonment he felt in the land of his own birth-an America that has sapped the creative energies of his race and transfigured humanity.

For biographer and film historian Ronald Bergan, Eisenstein, though his films are thoroughly Russian in content and context, belongs directly in the current of 20th-century Western art with such other 'cosmopolitan' Russians as Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninov, Vassili Kandinsky, Marc Chagall, Vladimir Nabokov, George Balanchine, and Sergei Diaghilev. A Life in Conflict is a fitting subtitle for this biography of the iconoclastic filmmaker, who was able to complete only seven feature-length films in a career spanning just over two decades, in the midst of frequent clashes with the Soviet Union's official tastemakers, including Joseph Stalin himself. (Among the book's highlights is a lengthy quotation from Eisenstein's journals transcribing a conversation he had with Stalin and other Soviet officials about mistakes in Ivan the Terrible, Part 2.) Critics have often denigrated Eisenstein for toeing the Communist Party line; Bergan reminds us that doing so was a simple matter of survival. Bergan also provides much more detail than previous accounts of the director's experiences in Hollywood under contract to Paramount, drawing upon Eisenstein's memoirs and Moscow archives. This personal material, which also helps contextualize decades of speculation about Eisenstein's sexuality and its relationship to his work, is perhaps the single factor that makes the biography worth reading no matter what one's degree of familiarity with the films. --Ron Hogan\n...more", "genre": ["Culture", "Film", "Biography"], "author": "Ronald Bergan", "rating": "3.83", "pages": "440"}, {"id": 1866459, "title": "Snowshoe Routes--Washington", "blurb": "This new edition continues the same format and features that made the first edition so popular.

The Communist government has encouraged them to plant garlic, but selling the crop is not as simple as they believed. Warehouses fill up, taxes skyrocket, and government officials maltreat even those who have traveled for days to sell their harvest. A surplus on the garlic market ensues, and the farmers must watch in horror as their crops wither and rot in the fields. Families are destroyed by the random imprisonment of young and old for supposed crimes against the state. The prisoners languish in horrifying conditions in their cells, with only their strength of character and thoughts of their loved ones to save them from madness. Meanwhile, a blind minstrel incites the masses to take the law into their own hands, and a riot of apocalyptic proportions follows with savage and unforgettable consequences. The Garlic Ballads is a powerful vision of life under the heel of an inflexible and uncaring government. It is also a delicate story of love between man and woman, father and child, friend and friend\u2014and the struggle to maintain that love despite overwhelming obstacles.\n...more", "genre": ["Cultural", "China", "Fiction", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Cultural", "Asia", "Nobel Prize", "Literature", "Asian Literature", "Chinese Literature", "Novels", "Literature", "Asian Literature", "Literature", "20th Century"], "author": "Mo Yan", "rating": "3.73", "pages": "286"}, {"id": 1868954, "title": "The Masque of Anarchy: Written on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester", "blurb": "The Masque of Anarchy (or The Mask of Anarchy) is a British political poem written in 1819 following the Peterloo massacre of that year.", "genre": ["Poetry", "Classics", "19th Century", "Politics", "History", "Romanticism", "School"], "author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley", "rating": "4.23", "pages": "Unknown"}, {"id": 1869094, "title": "Nothing Venture, Nothing Win", "blurb": "The remarkable life story of one of the greatest adventurers of our century - conqueror of Everest, Antarctic explorer, friend of the Sherpas and tireless traveller.

A must read. --The Living Church Fireweed, always the first flower to spring up and bloom in ruins and burned-over places, is Elizabeth Geitz's metaphor for evangelism that comes from the heart. It is the motivation that makes some Christians eager to welcome the stranger and invite people into their churches, while others hang back. In this prequel to Entertaining Angels: Hospitality Programs for the Caring Church, Geitz explores this missing ingredient in Christian hospitality, reminding us that in a multi-faith world where Christians wish to honor the validity of other religious paths, we may hesitate to talk about the uniqueness of Jesus Christ. Her book helps both individuals and communities to understand what holds them back from evangelism and discover the path that is right for them. This book unfolds in three sections. In the first we look at the factors that inhibit our evangelism, including the awareness that we live in a pluralistic world and do not wish to offend those with other faith commitments. Geitz offers both reflection and exercises to help us discover our own motivation for evangelism. Part 2 addresses the question of context. Where does evangelism take place, and for whose benefit? To what sort of communities do we invite those to whom we reach out? Section 3 focuses on the uniqueness of Christian hospitality and describes the nuts and bolts of newcomer ministry and the programs needed to sustain Christian hospitality in a pluralistic society. It includes workshop and group process material.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Elizabeth Geitz", "rating": "3.50", "pages": "163"}, {"id": 1871819, "title": "Damnation Crusade", "blurb": "In the nightmare future of the 41st millennium, Mankind teeters upon the brink of extinction.

You will be in the room with the private George Washington, braving threats of impeachment and assassination to make peace with England. John Adams, incurring his party's unrelenting hatred by refusing to fight France and warning his enemies, Great is the guilt of an unnecessary war. Andrew Jackson, in a death struggle against the corrupt Bank of the United States. Abraham Lincoln, risking his Presidency to insist that slaves be freed. Beschloss also shows us Theodore Roosevelt, taunting J. P. Morgan and the Wall Street leaders who dominated his party. Franklin Roosevelt, defying the isolationists - and maybe the law - to stop Adolf Hitler. Harry Truman, risking a walkout by top officials to recognize a Jewish state. John Kennedy, the belated champion of civil rights, complaining that he has cost himself a second term. And finally, two hundred years after Washington, Ronald Reagan, irking some of his oldest backers to seek an end to the Cold War.

This was once the question asked when a deformed infant was born. From classical antiquity through the Enlightenment, the monstrous child bore witness to the fearsome power of the mother's imagination. What such a notion meant and how it reappeared, transformed, in the Romantic period are the questions explored in this book, a fascinating study of theories linking imagination, art, and monstrous progeny.Down through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, philosophers and men of science rendered their learned opinions on the power of the female imagination to dominate, and thus distort, the act of procreation. Drawing on biological and physiological texts from classical times through the nineteenth century, Marie-Helene Huet presents this argument as it evolved and as it reflected doubts about the force of paternity. She shows how, in the late eighteenth century, the discussion shifted from the scientific sphere to the aesthetic, and how the idea of imagination as monstrous progenitor eventually became a Romantic conceit. In reinterpreting art as teratology, however, Romanticism reclaimed the subversive power of imagination as a masculine attribute; it was now the artist as monstrous father who would generate new forms. From Ambroise Pare to Diderot, from Shelley to Hawthorne, Balzac and Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, as Huet demonstrates, the monster and the work of art challenged preconceived ideas of the natural order of things--and disclosed, for all to see, the silent desire of their makers: to procreate without the other.In this analysis of monstrous genesis Huet examines anew such questions as the authorship of Frankenstein, the birth of the Tussaud wax museum, and the ancient legend of the golem.

This text provides the conceptual development and geometric visualization of a modern differential equations course while maintaining the solid foundation of algebraic techniques that are still essential to science and engineering students. It reflects the new excitement in differential equations as the availability of technical computing environments like Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB reshape the role and applications of the discipline. New technology has motivated a shift in emphasis from traditional, manual methods to both qualitative and computer-based methods that render accessible a wider range of realistic applications.

Set since 1814 until 1914.\nSet in the revolutionary Europe around 1848, this is the story of two Hungarian brothers who occupy opposing political and ideological camps: Dali, a fiery, freedom-loving romantic, and Antal, a conservative bureaucrat.

In an instant the man had thrown aside his cloak, revealing a hideous and frightful appearance. Blue and white flames shot from his mouth, and his eyes appeared like balls of fire. The young girl who witnessed all this was so terrified that she fainted right away.This is just one of dozens of contemporary reports of the bizarre criminal who for over sixty years held the British population in a grip of fear. A man known only as SPRING HEELED JACK.During the period of his reign of terror, this frightening, agile figure who attacked unwary travellers and pounced on terrified girls and women - and may have been responsible for several murders - attracted as many headlines and alarmed the authorities as much as his later mysterious compatriot in crime, Jack the Ripper.From the late 1830's he confounded the police, outwitted all attempts by the Army to catch him, and even boldly confronted law officers -slapping them across the face with his `ice cold hands' before disappearing into the darkness with his eerie laugh ringing behind him....Today, though, while Jack the Ripper is the subject of book after book, SPRING HEELED JACK has become just a name associated with anyone who jumps well. His real story is unknown. This is the first book to examine the legend in detail and throw new light on who the man behind the mask might have been.Peter Haining's fascinating study not only examines the reports of his activities - and suggests that more than one person adopted the disguise, including a famous nobleman -but discusses his fame as a star bf Victorian melodrama, and considers some of the strange theories that have been advanced about him -including one that he was really a spaceman!The book is fully illustrated with remarkable engravings and photographs and includes a special section from one of the famous Penny Dreadful serials which featured the legend of the extraordinary SPRING HEELED JACK.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Peter Haining", "rating": "2.80", "pages": "192"}, {"id": 1875975, "title": "Berserker", "blurb": "Long ago, in a distant part of the galaxy, two alien races met--and fought a war of mutual extinction.

He tracks the influence of religious thought on capitalist economy and ideology since the Middle Ages, shedding light on the question of why Christianity continues to exert a unique role in the marketplace. In so doing, the book offers an incisive analysis of the morals and mores of contemporary Western culture.Religion and the Rise of Capitalism is more pertinent now than ever, as today the dividing line between the spheres of religion and secular business is shifting, blending ethical considerations with the motivations of the marketplace. By examining the period that saw the transition from medieval to modern theories of social organization, Tawney clarifies the most pressing problems of the end of the century. In tough, muscular, richly varied prose, he tells an absorbing and meaningful story. And in his new introduction, which may well be a classic in its own right, Adam Seligman details Tawney's background and the current status of academic thought on these issues, and he provides a comparative analysis of Tawney with Max Weber that will at once delight and inform readers.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Religion", "Economics", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "Philosophy", "Sociology", "Religion", "Christianity", "History", "European History", "Religion", "Theology"], "author": "R.H.

Paul Lawrence and Nitin Nohria have studied the way people behave in that most fascinating arena of human behavior-the workplace-and from their work they produce a book that examines the four separate and distinct emotive drives that guide human behavior and influence the choices people make: the drives to acquire, bond, learn, and defend.

Today we can draw on worldwide computer links, speeding up communications by radio, newspapers, and television. Ideas fly back and forth and circle the globe at the speed of electricity. And just around the corner lurks full-blown virtual reality, in which we will be able to immerse ourselves in a computer simulation not only of the actual physical world, but of any imagined world. As we begin to move in and out of a computer-generated world, Michael Heim asks, how will the way we perceive our world change? In The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, Heim considers this and other philosophical issues of the Information Age. With an eye for the dark as well as the bright side of computer technology, he explores the logical and historical origins of our computer-generated world and speculates about the future direction of our computerized lives. He discusses such topics as the effect of word-processing on the English language (while word-processors have led to increased productivity, they have also led to physical hazards such as repetitive motion syndrome, which causes inflamed hand and arm tendons). Heim looks into the new kind of literacy promised by Hypertext (technology which allows the user to link audio and video elements, the disadvantages including disorientation and cognitive overload). And he also probes the notion of virtual reality, cyberspace--the computer-simulated environments that have captured the popular imagination and may ultimately change the way we define realityitself. Just as the definition of interface itself has evolved from the actual adapter plug used to connect electronic circuits into human entry into a self-contained cyberspace, so too will the notion of reality change with the current technological drive. Like the introduction of the automobile, the advent of virtual reality will change the whole context in which our knowledge and awareness of life are rooted. And along the way, Heim covers such intriguing topics as how computers have altered our thought habits, how we will be able to distinguish virtual from real reality, and the appearance of virtual reality in popular culture (as in Star Trek's holodeck, William Gibson's Neuromancer, and Stephen King's Lawnmower Man). Vividly and entertainingly written, The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality opens a window on a fascinating world that promises--or threatens--to become an integral part of everyday life in the 21st century. As Heim writes, not only do we face a breakthrough in the technology of computer interface, but we face the challenge of knowing ourselves and determining how the technology should develop and ultimately affect the society in which it grows.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Michael Heim", "rating": "3.54", "pages": "208"}, {"id": 1879770, "title": "Meg's Car", "blurb": "A car is all very well if you know how to drive it, but if you're Meg, or Mog, in a hurry to go on a picnic, you really are safer on a broomstick.", "genre": ["Picture Books", "Childrens", "Adventure"], "author": "Helen Nicoll", "rating": "3.77", "pages": "32"}, {"id": 1879780, "title": "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon", "blurb": "UPON my return to the United States a few months ago, after the extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages, accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon m\nUPON my return to the United States a few months ago, after the extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages, accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. I had several reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself, others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was, that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write, from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess, barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties. Another reason was, that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous, that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family, and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put faith in my veracity- the probability being that the public at large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer was, never- theless, one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestion of my advisers.\n...more", "genre": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Horror", "Adventure", "Gothic", "Literature", "19th Century", "Fantasy", "Literature", "Literature", "American", "Novels"], "author": "Edgar Allan Poe", "rating": "3.51", "pages": "264"}, {"id": 1879805, "title": "Winter Hedgehog Mini Treasure", "blurb": "One of a series of small-format paperback editions of popular picture books, this is the story of a hedgehog that decides not to hibernate for the winter.", "genre": ["Childrens"], "author": "Ann Cartwright", "rating": "3.62", "pages": "32"}, {"id": 1879825, "title": "Bouquet d'\u00e9pines", "blurb": "Christopher and Cathy have made a loving home for their handsome and talented teenager Jory, their imaginative nine-year-old Bart, and a sweet baby daughter.

As preamble, Asimov reviews human physical limitations: horizons defined by human eyes, legs, and so on. Then, in true Baconian scientific spirit, he celebrates the experiments, methods, and measurements that have extended human horizons in space, time, matter, and energy. The result is a bird's-eye view of history and invention, science and industry. Spatial horizons make up the bulk of the work, what with Asimov discoursing on the ancient Mediterranean world, Marco Polo, the age of exploration, the conquest of the poles, the eras of ballooning, flight, and space--with asides on oceanography and mountaineering. Time horizons have to do with the ever-finer splicings of time (did you know that second simply means the second division of an hour?) and the clever timepieces that made precision possible--inevitably leading to questions of the age of the earth, the universe, and living creatures, and the conundrums of relativity and time travel. The horizons of matter are graded from the mini to the mighty in living and non-living matter, with sections on weight, mass, density, and pressure. In horizons of energy, the subjects are heat, temperature, and luminosity; predictably, Asimov raises cosmological questions on the fate of the universe, and describes the blackness of black holes and the brightness of quasars. He's said many of these things before, of course; but they are condensed and tied together here in highly satisfactory fashion, with the earthy wit (black holes as cosmic subways) and the usual scattering of Guinness record-type tidbits.

In the most deadly and secret struggle of the new cold war, the Russians set their sights on the US President and attempt to manipulate fanatical Islamic terrorists to play a role in their ambitious scheme. Only one man can stop them and avert a tragedy of terrifying proportions - CIA officer Art Bennington.FROM New York Daily News, by Bill BellPay attention, class, for this is a thriller about magnetoencephalography, which is (A) a Wales train stop or (B) the science of recording magnetic fields of the brain.B, you say?Ah, then you are ready to pick up MAZE, a most complicated brain science thriller by Larry Collins (Simon & Schuster, $19.95), whose previous works, as co-auther, landed him on the best-seller lists with O Jerusalem, ''Or I'll Dress You in Mourning and Is Paris Burning?This one has scraps and bits of everything - Soviet sleepers in Washington, terrorists in Beirut, plotters at the Kremlin, uprisings by Russian ethnics and extrasensory perception. Plus, above all, a plot to provoke the U.S. president into doing something so rash that it would shift the balance of world power.To drive the president bonkers, the Kremlin baddies need access to the data recorded on a - here we go again - magnetoencephalograph used when he took his physical at Bethesda Naval Hospital.The president flies into a rage (bad political news while he is undergoing the exam) and a clever Russian female scientist has discovered a way to provoke his rage on command - with an electromagnetic signal.Soon a hotshot Soviet agent has sneaked into Washington to steal a computer disc containing the data. He does, with the help of a long-time sleeper who has, incidentally, just slept with our CIA hero.Now, the bad Russkies can bombard the White House with the electromagnetic signals that release the chemicals that trigger the chief executive's rage. OK so far? Plus, they organize a terrorist bombing of a high school dance at a West German military base, cleverly arranged to look like the work of the ayatollah.The president orders a White House crisis meeting to deal with the attack, and zap! just like that, the president goes ape. Soon, he is ordering a nuclear strike on the ayatollah.Now our hero, who has a background in psychic studies, solves the mystery and before you can say magnetoencephalography, foils the plot.It's all very lively and exotic. It and a tube of sunblock should make for a nice weekend at the beach.From Publishers Weekly...uncanny command of the inner workings of the international intelligence apparatus.... The action begins with the KGB's murder of a New York psychic with a flair for locating the coordinates of Soviet submarines. She had been helpful in CIA mind experiments, but the Russians are onto something even better: a device that uses electromagnetic waves to trigger responses in the brains of unsuspecting people at a distance. The KGB intends to use this magneto-encephalogram to zap the U.S. president during a crisis. First, Arab terrorists controlled by Moscow blow up a U.S. Army-run high school in Germany, killing many teenagers. Then the zapping of the president begins, and our enraged, mentally unhinged Chief Executive gives the order to nuke Iran in retaliation.

That was my experience when I read The Confessions of Noa Weber.-Eleonora Lev, Ha'aretz Acclaimed middle-aged writer Noa Weber-acclaimed both as a writer and as one of Israel's leading feminists-has all the trappings of a successful feminist life: She has a strong career, a wonderful daughter she raised alone, and she's a respected cultural figure. Yet her interior life is inextricably bound by her love for a man-Alek, a Russian emigre and the father of her child, who, over the years, has drifted in and out of her life.Trying to understand-as well as free herself from-this lifelong obsession, Noa turns her pen upon herself, and with relentless honesty dissects her life. Against the evocative setting of turbulent, modern-day Israel, the examination becomes a quest-to transform the nature of her love from irrational desire to a greater, transcendent comprehension of the sublime.The Confessions of Noa Weber introduces to the English-speaking world a startlingly talented writer in a rich tale that illuminates the desires, yearnings, and complexities of life in Israel, and of people trying to balance the needs of the secular world with the ultimate need and desire for transcendence.Gail Hareven is one of Israel's leading writers; the author of five novels, three short story collections, plays, a nonfiction book, and two children's books; and the winner of the prestigious Sapir Prize forThe Confessions of Noa Weber.

At centre stage of this ground breaking book is the extraordinary work of Grupo Cultural AfroReggae, a Rio-based NGO which seeks to divert favela residents from the path of poverty and violence, through music and an appreciation of black culture. AfroReggae are a force for real social change; they are also a model for what is possible when an oppressed community decides to resist the twin onslaugh of violence and poverty. This book is co-authored by a prize-winning fiction and non-fiction writer.\n...more", "genre": ["Music"], "author": "Patrick Neate", "rating": "3.74", "pages": "174"}, {"id": 1882115, "title": "Secure in Heart: Overcoming Insecurity in a Woman's Life", "blurb": "Being secure in heart is about knowing who God is, who Jesus is, who you are, and being able to apply this knowledge in a way that sets you free.

For each of these questions, the author shows how to identify Satan\u2019s false securities and then how to overcome them by understanding and applying God\u2019s nature. Through stories from her life and the lives of other women, Weidner brings this hidden struggle into the light, giving women confidence to engage their battle and fight for their true heritage as daughters of God.

Instead, books have tended to focus on dress history, although recently the discipline has taken a more theoretical turn, with a spate of books appearing that analyze the underlying forces motivating fashion. This pioneering book unites theory and practice to provide an integrated series of snapshots taken from different perspectives of the fashion business in the second half of the twentieth century.Featuring contributions by leading experts in three main areas of important debate within the industry - the theory and culture of fashion; design and industry; and image and marketing - the book will be an essential reference for students, practitioners and theoreticians. It addresses such key issues as: the relationship between culture and clothing; the intersection of fashion and modernity; the origins of glamour; the role of creativity and the power of design; the chain store challenge; the age of the thinking designer; retail concepts; and minimalism in fashion.

In the Raj of the 1920s, the racial and social divides are enormous, but Pran Nath is able to bridge them, crossing from one side to another in a series of reinventions of his own personality. He begins as the spoiled child of an Indian lawyer, but circumstances thrust him out of his pampered adolescence into the teeming and dangerous life of the streets. After a bewildering period as one of the pawns in Machiavellian political and sexual scheming in the decadent court of a minor Maharajah, he escapes to Bombay. There he is taken up by a half-demented Scottish missionary and his wife, but Pran Nath prefers to slope off to the city's red-light district whenever he can. During a time of riot and bloodshed, the chance of re-creating himself as an English schoolboy destined for public school and Oxford presents itself, and he takes it. But this is not his final transformation. In certain ways Kunzru is almost too ambitious. There is so much crammed onto the pages of The Impressionist that some of it, almost inevitably, doesn't work as well as it might. However, as the shapeshifting Pran Nath moves from one identity to another, knockabout farce mixes with satire, social comedy with parody. And beneath the comic exuberance and linguistic invention, there is an intelligent and occasionally moving examination of notions of self, identity, and what it means to belong to a class or society. --Nick Rennison, Amazon.co.uk", "genre": ["Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "India", "Literary Fiction", "Asia", "Historical", "Contemporary"], "author": "Hari Kunzru", "rating": "3.61", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 1882817, "title": "A\u00efe, Mes A\u00efeux !:  Liens Transg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnels, Secrets De Famille, Syndrome D'anniversaire, Transmission Des Traumatismes Et Pratique Du G\u00e9nosociogramme", "blurb": "L'auteure livre, \u00e0 travers son analyse clinique et sa pratique professionnelle de pr\u00e8s d'une vingtaine d'ann\u00e9es, une th\u00e9rapie transg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnelle psychog\u00e9n\u00e9alogique contextuelle.

John Henry Newman claimed in The Idea of a University that post-Reformation English literature was overwhelmingly Protestant and that there was no prospect of a Catholic body of literature. Describing this claim as happily lacking in prescience, Ian Ker persuasively argues that Newman, Hopkins, Belloc, Chesterton, Greene, and Waugh succeeded in producing a substantial body of literature written by Catholics who wrote as Catholics. These revivalists were not so much influenced by traditional themes of guilt, sin, and ceremony, as they were attracted to unexpected facets of Catholicism. The idea of a Catholic priest as a craftsman is a recurring motif, as is the celebration of the ordinariness and objectivity of Catholicism.

Now Lansky needs Weiss\nA thrilling debut that puts an unforgettable new spin on the World War II suspense novel: what if the Resistance had approached the notorious Jewish gangster Meyer Lansky for help?  Leonard Mouse Weiss has worked as a hit man for Meyer Lansky-the legendary Brooklyn Jewish crime boss-for years. But with his last drop, Mouse has blown it, big-time. Now Lansky needs Weiss out of town fast . . . and along comes the perfect opportunity.  An underground Resistance movement based in Europe needs muscle and money to intercept a train carrying Dutch Jews to their deaths. They've timed their plan carefully. The U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Service are about to meet in Bermuda to discuss what is happening to Europe's Jews, and if this rescue can be pulled off while the conference is under way, it could finally galvanize the Allies to take action.  Killing two birds with one stone, Lansky sends a reluctant Mouse to do the job with simple instructions: Do not screw this one up. But Hitler's Europe isn't Canal Street, and before he knows it, Mouse finds himself ensnared in a race against capture that grows more complicated and deadly with each passing second. And this time he's looking out for more than just himself.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction"], "author": "Gregg Keizer", "rating": "3.33", "pages": "384"}, {"id": 1883669, "title": "Killer Elite: The Inside Story of America's Most Secret Special Operations Team", "blurb": "A top-secret U.S. Army Special Operations unit has been running covert missions all over the world, from leading death squads to the hideout of drug baron Pablo Escobar to assassinating key al Qaeda members, including Iraqi leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and, in one of their greatest missions, capturing Saddam Hussein.

'The Activity, as it became known to insiders, has achieved near-mythical status, even among the world's Special Operations elite. Now journalist Michael Smith gets inside this clandestine military team to expose their explosive history and secrets. The Activity's story begins with the abortive attempt to rescue the American hostages from Iran in 1980. One of the main reasons Operation Eagle Claw failed was a chronic lack of intel on the ground, so in January 1981, U.S. military chiefs set up the Intelligence Support Activity, a cover name for a secret army surveillance team that could operate undercover anywhere in the world. Hidden from the politicians and the government bean counters, it would carry out deniable operations preparing the way for Delta and SEAL Team Six. Michael Smith has spoken to many former members of the Activity, and we follow them on operations from the war on the drug barons that led Colombian death squads to the hideouts of Pablo Escobar and his men. We learn of more recent missions, including snatching war criminals from their safe houses in the Balkans (at one time disguising themselves as French soldiers to lull a Serb warlord into a false sense of security), and operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Horn of Africa. Killer Elite reveals the incredible truth behind the world's most secret Special Operations organization, a unit that is at the forefront of the War on Terror.\n\n...more", "genre": ["War", "Military Fiction", "History", "Nonfiction", "War", "Military", "Military History", "Politics", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Spy Thriller", "Espionage"], "author": "Michael          Smith", "rating": "3.90", "pages": "352"}, {"id": 1883719, "title": "The Pine Barrens", "blurb": "Contrary to popular opinion, the whole of New Jersey is not a continuous Superfund site enlivened solely by poorly labeled Turnpike exits and skanky diners.

A panicked Winston Churchill wrote: Tobruk seems to be the place to be held to the death without thought of retirement...nothing must hamper the capture of Tobruk. In the dark heart of World War II, when Hitler turned his attentions to conquering North Africa, a distracted and far-flung Allied force could not give its all to the defence of the key city of Tobruk in Libya. So the job was left to the roughest, toughest bunch they could muster. Tobruk is the story of an incredible battle in excruciating desert heat through nine long months, against the might of Adolf Hitler's formidable Afrika Korps. This force's defence of Tobruk against the Afrika Korps' armoured division is one of the great battles of all time, yet rarely talked about. Drawing on extensive source material - including diaries and letters, some never published before - this extraordinary book is the definitive account of this remarkable battle. While Peter Fitzsimons is a celebrated historian, his popularity stems from his fantastic storytelling. Tobruk is written in a narrative style, putting the reader next to men such as General Leslie Morshead as he decides the fate of his men, next to men such as Jack Harris, as he stands in the blood of an injured mate.

In this important new work, Mardy Ireland defines a place for women outside the parameters of motherhood and gives voice to the significant number of women who are not mothers. She draws extensively from interviews with over 100 childless women from various ethnic and educational backgrounds, demonstrating the myriad ways they came to view themselves as complete adults without recourse to the traditional defining criteria of motherhood. Her work offers all women--mothers and nonmothers alike--a vision of self-defined adulthood and a recognition that every woman is the subject of her own life. Challenging the assumption of deprivation or deviance that is traditionally applied to childless women in psychological theory and popular culture, Dr. Ireland reframes childlessness as a concept and lays a groundwork for an expanded view of women's identity and psychic development. Using contemporary psychoanalytic theory, she reexamines female identity development and presents a positive interpretation of women who--for whatever reason--are not mothers.To contrast and compare the experiences of her interview subjects, she places them within the changing psychosocial context of the last few decades and categorizes them according to their reasons for childlessness. Included are: 'traditional' women, who are childless by reasons of infertility or health complications; 'transitional' women, who are not mothers because of delaying circumstances; and 'transformative' women, who have actively chosen not to bear children in order to develop lives beyond the field of motherhood. The legend of Lilith, a creation story of the first woman, described in the last chapter, places both female desire and female power in a longstanding historical and mythic context. Animated by excerpts, quotes, and stories from the many interviews, RECONCEIVING WOMEN: SEPARATING MOTHERHOOD FROM FEMALE IDENTITY is illuminating for general readers and professionals alike. It provides valuable insights for anyone interested in women's studies and the psychology of women, and serves as an excellent textbook for courses in these fields. \n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Feminism"], "author": "Mardy S.

Breakthrough Japanese is a lively, reader-friendly book that amplifies and reinforces the skills gained from more conventional textbooks. Designed to stimulate or rekindle a learner's curiosity, it is packed with activities that make language speaking fun. At the same time, learners at all levels, from beginning to advanced, will find many useful expressions and speaking strategies throughout its pages. Author Hitomi Hirayama is the director of Japanese Lunch, a popular language school in Tokyo. Her teaching methods focus primarily on communication: she explains fundamental points of grammar, but with a succinctness and clarity that even advanced students will appreciate. She combines these with crossword puzzles, word games, practice conversations, proverb practice, and kanji games that make her book perfect for use in the classroom or, equally, for self-study. Hirayama makes it easier for students to finally grasp the big concepts like the difference between wa and ga. She also has a unique way of introducing ideas that are applicable to any Japanese conversation, such as what she calls the large-to-small rule of sentence structure, and the way that word order in a sentence is basically up to the speaker. Her method instills confidence and helps readers take their Japanese skills to the next level. New to the language? An old Japan-hand? Someone who has had some study, but then forgotten it all? Regardless, Breakthrough Japanese will make the language seem less formidable and more fun.\n...more", "genre": ["Asian Literature", "Japanese Literature"], "author": "\u5e73\u5c71 \u3072\u3068\u307f", "rating": "3.89", "pages": "192"}, {"id": 1887469, "title": "Channeling Your Higher Self", "blurb": "Channeling is a fascinating mystery.

In many ways the paper 'The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English' (commonly abbreviated PTQ) represents the culmination of Montague's efforts to apply the techniques developed within mathematical logic to the semantics of natural languages, and indeed it is the system outlined there that people generally have in mind when they refer to Montague Grammar. (We prefer the term Montague Semantics inasmuch as a grammar, as conceived of in current linguistics, would contain at least a phonological component, a morphological component, and other subsystems which are either lacking entirely or present only in a very rudi mentary state in the PTQ system. ) Montague's work has attracted increasing attention in recent years among linguists and philosophers since it offers the hope that semantics can be characterized with the same formal rigor and explicitness that transformational approaches have brought to syntax. Whether this hope can be fully realized remains to be seen, but it is clear nonetheless that Montague semantics has already established itself as a productive para digm, leading to new areas of inquiry and suggesting new ways of conceiving of theories of natural language.

'In a world where advantage increasingly depends upon movement rather than position, Judo Strategy drills home the ultimate principle of strategy: maximize impact while minimizing effort. This is easy to say but difficult to accomplish. The authors provide pragmatic techniques and examples to help make this principle come alive. Don't enter the market without this book' - John Hagel, Author, Net Gain and Net Worth, and Chief Strategy Officer, 12 Entrepreneuring, Inc. Why do some companies succeed in defeating stronger rivals, while others fail? This is a question that, sooner or later, all ambitious competitors must face.Whether you're a tiny start-up taking on industry giants or a giant moving into markets dominated by powerful incumbents, the basic problem remains the same: How do you compete with opponents who have size, strength, and history on their side? The answer lies in a simple but powerful lesson: Rather than oppose strength to strength, successful challengers use their opponents' size and power to bring them down. This is the message at the heart of Judo Strategy. Based on extensive research by Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie and research associate Mary Kwak, Judo Strategy introduces a groundbreaking approach to competition that shows companies how to win against imposing odds. Using vivid examples from companies ranging from Wal-Mart and Charles Schwab to Juniper Networks and Palm Computing, the authors demonstrate how managers can translate the core principles of judo - a martial art that prizes skill not size - into a winning business strategy.By mastering movement, managers learn to seize the lead and make the most of their initial advantage. By maintaining balance, they can successfully engage with opponents and respond to rivals' attacks. And finally, by exploiting leverage, managers can transform their competitors' strengths into strategic liabilities. This book will help any company - large or small, new or old, virtual or physical - become a more effective competitor. In addition to developing the concept of judo strategy, it presents a defensive primer - in the form of sumo strategy - for companies facing judo attacks.Packed with the insights of world-class managers and strategists, Judo Strategy does double duty: it can help you become a giant-killer, while also teaching you to protect your hard-fought position from challengers in the wings.\n...more", "genre": ["Business"], "author": "David B.

It\u2019s a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don\u2019t need to do business with.This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride.

In the spring of 1989, three young people, born thousands of miles apart, each cut themselves adrift from their birthplaces and set out to discover what \u2014 or who \u2014 might anchor them in their lives. They each leave almost everything behind, carrying with them only a few artefacts of their lives so far \u2014 possessions that have proven so formative that they can\u2019t imagine surviving without them \u2014 but also the accumulated memories of their own lives and family histories.Noah, who was taught to read using road maps during a life of nomadic travels with his mother \u2014 their home being a 1966 Bonneville station wagon with a silver trailer \u2014 decides to leave the prairies for university in Montreal. But putting down roots there turns out to be a more transitory experience than he expected. Joyce, stifled by life in a remote village on Quebec\u2019s Lower North Shore, and her overbearing relatives, hitches a ride into Montreal, spurred on by a news story about a modern-day cyber-pirate and the spirit of her own buccaneer ancestors. While her daily existence remains surprisingly routine \u2014working at a fish shop in Jean-Talon market, dumpster-diving at night for necessities \u2014 it\u2019s her Internet piracy career that takes off. And then there\u2019s the unnamed narrator, who we first meet clearing out his deceased mother\u2019 s house on Montreal\u2019s South Shore, and who decides to move into the city to start a new life. There he finds his true home among books, content to spend his days working in a used bookstore and journeying though the many worlds books open up for him.Over the course of the next ten years, Noah, Joyce and the unnamed bookseller will sometimes cross paths, and sometimes narrowly miss each other, as they all pass through one vibrant neighbourhood on Montreal\u2019s Plateau. Their journeys seem remarkably unformed, more often guided by the prevailing winds than personal will, yet their stories weave in and out of other wondrous tales \u2014 stories about such things as fearsome female pirates, urban archaeologists, unexpected floods, fish of all kinds, a mysterious book without a cover and a dysfunctional compass whose needle obstinately points to the remote Aleutian village of Nikolski. And it is in the magical accumulation of those details around the edges of their lives that we begin to know these individuals as part of a greater whole, and ultimately realize that anchors aren\u2019t at all permanent, really; rather, they\u2019re made to be hoisted up and held in reserve until their strength is needed again.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Canada", "Literature", "Canadian Literature", "Literature", "Contemporary", "Cultural", "France", "Literary Fiction", "Book Club", "Roman", "Adult Fiction"], "author": "Nicolas Dickner", "rating": "3.49", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 1891533, "title": "The Secret of Perfect Vision: How You Can Prevent or Reverse Nearsightedness", "blurb": "Author David De Angelis\u2019s search for a cure for nearsightedness was both professional and personal, since he suffered from the disease himself.

Presenting exemplary works of criticism incorporating personal narratives, this volume brings together twenty-seven essays from scholars in literary studies and history, mathematics and medicine, philosophy, music, film, ethnic studies, law, education, anthropology, religion, and biology. Pioneers in the development of the hybrid genre of personal scholarship, the writers whose work is presented here challenge traditional modes of inquiry and ways of knowing. In assembling their work, editors Diane P. Freedman and Olivia Frey have provided a rich source of reasons for and models of autobiographical criticism.The editors\u2019 introduction presents a condensed history of academic writing, chronicles the origins of autobiographical criticism, and emphasizes the role of feminism in championing the value of personal narrative to disciplinary discourse. The essays are all explicitly informed by the identities of their authors, among whom are a feminist scientist, a Jewish filmmaker living in Germany, a potential carrier of Huntington\u2019s disease, and a doctor pregnant while in medical school. Whether describing how being a professor of ethnic literature necessarily entails being an activist, how music and cooking are related, or how a theology is shaped by cultural identity, the contributors illuminate the relationship between their scholarly pursuits and personal lives and, in the process, expand the boundaries of their disciplines.Contributors:Kwame Anthony AppiahRuth BeharMerrill BlackDavid BleichJames ConeBrenda DalyLaura B.

Half a million Somalis died that year, and over a million fled the country. Cameras followed US troops as they landed on the beaches at Mogadishu to lead what became an ill-fated UN intervention to end hunger and restore peace.In this book, Somali women write and talk about the war, their experiences and the unacceptable choices they often faced. They explain clearly, in their own words, the changes, challenges \u2013 and sometimes the opportunities \u2013 that war brought, and how they coped with them. Key themes include the slaughter and loss of men, who were the prime target for killings; rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war; changing roles in the family and within the pastoralist economy; women mobilising for peace; and leading social recovery in a war-torn society. This book is not only an important record of women's experience of war, but also provides researchers and students of gender and conflict with rare first hand accounts highlighting the impact of war on gender relations, and women's struggle for equal political rights in a situation of state collapse.\n...more", "genre": ["Eastern Africa", "Somalia"], "author": "Judith Gardner", "rating": "4.25", "pages": "272"}, {"id": 1892599, "title": "Forrest Gump", "blurb": "\u017bycie idioty to nie bu\u0142ka z mas\u0142em - powiada Forrest Gump, bohater i narrator bestsellerowej powie\u015bci W.

Much in the same way that Jane Goodall devoted her life to living with and recording the behavioral patterns of the wild mountain chimps of Gombi, so has Bombeck recorded our mating habits, maternal instincts, reproductive cycles, how we handle trends and technology, what makes us laugh, and what makes us cry. In her inimitably warm and witty style, Bombeck has discovered that the odd habits of the animal kingdom are strikingly similar to our own, and she reports her downright hilarious findings in All I Know About Animal Behavior I Learned in Loehmann's Dressing Room. Bombeck shows how close animals in the wild and humans really are, and how much we can learn from one another. The hippopotamus is a vegetarian and looks like a wall. Lions who eat only red meat are sleek and slim. Are nutritionists on the wrong track? From the garter snake transvestite, to the barn swallow who can't make a commitment, to the lion who mates eighty-six times a day, Bombeck reveals that we're not all that far removed from the animal world. An African monkey who picked the lock on every cage he'd ever been in got twenty minutes on a National Geographic special. Bombeck had a cousin with the same skill; he got two years.Bombeck proves that a behaviorist need not wear a safari jacket and live in a tent in order to be an expert on every facet of a species' behavior. From the aerobics classroom -- where humans defend their territory to the death by spraying their mates with their own personal perfume -- to our migratory patterns -- where, likea certain species of butterfly, we fly to Miami in hordes the minute the temperature dips below sixty, Bombeck demonstrates in her quintessential style that while animals may have more fun, longer tails, and better sex lives, the gap that separates us from the animal kingdom is closing... fast.\n...more", "genre": ["Humor", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Essays", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Humor", "Comedy", "Animals", "Audiobook", "Biography", "Biography Memoir", "Anthologies", "Collections"], "author": "Erma Bombeck", "rating": "4.03", "pages": "207"}, {"id": 1892634, "title": "Northanger Abbey", "blurb": "Jane Austen is a genius, and Northanger Abbey is hugely underrated.-Martin Amis Catherine Morland is a young girl with a very active imagination.

Players and students, music historians, and Haydn lovers will have inexpensive access to a uniform, strongly bound, and clearly printed modern edition of Haydn's finest pieces in complete score. Musicians, music students, and music publishers have a difficult time keeping up with Haydn, whose ceaseless production of original, first-rate work was legendary. He essayed most of the recognized genres, confessing upon several a legacy of expanded possibilities and clearly defined, characteristic form. Among these may be mentioned the symphony, the sonata, and perhaps most notably, the quartet. In a period of 50 years, Haydn (1732\u20131809) composed over 80 string quartets. Scholars are still debating questions of attribution and even completeness (unknown works by Haydn still turn up) and music lovers have had to make do with scattered, out-of-date, out-of-print editions of a few of the more familiar quartets. Haydn's affinity to the quartet began with his earliest works, when he perhaps more than anyone established the 4-movement structure of chamber music. In common with truly great and complete artists, who surpass early innovation to achieve their greatest work at the end, Haydn's last quarters are his best.

While these three bigger-than-life characters are vividly portrayed, this is mostly a story about technology: where the ideas come from, how it's developed, how internal company politics affects its development, and how outside companies are courted and cajoled to participate. Drummond, a skillful writer and dogged journalist, thoroughly explains all the technology--but, in the end, the acronyms take over. This makes for a tough read if you're not technologically inclined.

Four years later, to distract her from her fear as cannonballs batter the besieged city, Rosemary writes about what she has been through.While she has been growing up, enjoying the social pleasures of a Southern young lady, the tensions between North and South have developed into civil war. Because she is English, Rosemary brings an outsider's perspective to the issues that sparked the conflict, but nonetheless she is torn between her sense of outrage at the very idea of slavery and her feelings for the Southerners she has come to love. For Rosemary, her brother Derek, and their American friends -- old and young, white and black -- the disastrous siege of Vicksburg comes as a crucial test of courage and the will to survive.Once again, Patricia Clapp has created a heroine of wit, charm, and indomitable spirit in a vividly evoked historical setting.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Young Adult", "Military History", "Civil War", "Fiction", "Childrens", "Historical", "Childrens", "Juvenile", "Romance", "Literature", "19th Century", "American History", "American Civil War"], "author": "Patricia Clapp", "rating": "4.02", "pages": "224"}, {"id": 1896215, "title": "El Poder y La Gloria: La Historia Oculta del Papado de Juan Pablo II", "blurb": "Juan Pablo II Fue uno de los personajes mas carismaticos de la segunda mitad del siglo XX.

Tras una carrera meteorica en el seno de la Iglesia, se convirtio en papa de forma sorprendente a la muerte de su antecesor Juan Pablo I. Entonces comenzo uno de los mas largos pontificados de la historia, caracterizado por los numerosos viajes de Wojtyla y por su enorme exposicion a los medios de comunicacion, pero tambien por coincidir en el tiempo con algunos sucesos historicos fundamentales como el fin de la guerra fria y el derrumbe del comunismo.Como ya hizo en su polemico libro sobre la muerte de Juan Pablo I, En Nombre de Dios, el escritor y renombrado investigador David Yallop se aparta de nuevo de la historia oficial y del ensalzamiento gratuito, para diseccionar la figura y el legado de Karol Wojtyla. Con abundancia de datos y testimonios de la CIA, la KGB y de los mismos miembros de la curia vaticana, el libro reconstruye un pontificado tan grandioso en sus propositos como corto en sus resultados. Yallop atribuye este desequilibrio a un estilo excesivamente personalista y a los grandes tropiezos--su incapacidad para abordar el problema de la corrupcion de las finanzas vaticanas, su pasividad a la hora de denunciar y de enfrentarse a los casos de abuso sexual protagonizados por eclesiasticos y su ferrea obstinacion en rechazar las reformas solicitadas por millones de fieles y por una parte significativa del clero--que ensombrecieron su trayectoria.El Poder y la Gloria es una mirada audaz e intrepida a un hombre rapidamente encaminado a la santificacion y su profundo efecto en un instituto sumamente polarizado.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Religion", "Biography", "Politics"], "author": "David A.

Magnus writes to explain himself to his son, Tom; le Carr\u00e9 wrote the book to explain his own scalawag dad to himself, and burst into tears when he finished the novel.

Can Western spies trust the dissident? Just how safe is the safe house where Barley parleys with his sexy Russian contact, Katya? Where should Barley's loyalty lie, with love or country? The Secret Pilgrim is almost a short-story collection. (That's why it was broken into three separate audio versions: The Fledgling Spy, The Spy Who Came of Age, and The Spy in His Prime.)

Beginning in ancient Spain, where Hannibal's father had carved out a Carthaginian empire, the novel traces the origins of the war, the opening moves, and Hannibal's inspired choice to attack Rome via a land route most believed impossible. In graphic, panoramic prose, Durham describes the battles, including the icy slaughter of the Trebia; the mist-shrouded battle along Lake Trasimene; the battle of Cannae, in which Hannibal's outnumbered force surrounded and decimated seventy thousand Romans in a single afternoon; and Zama, the hard slog that proved to be the decisive contest. Along the way we meet a variety of major historical figures on both sides of the conflict, as well as characters representing the vast array of other ethnicities who played a part in the war: Iberians and Gauls, Numidians and Libyans, Macedonians and Moors. Hannibal's family is brought to life: his wife, mother, sisters, and young son, as is Publius Scipio, the young Roman who was the only match for Hannibal's genius on the field of battle \u2014 and who eventually defeated him.

If we are to continue to draw from the sciences to create and manage organizations, then we need to at least ground our work in the science of our times. We need to stop seeking after the universe of the seventeenth century and begin to explore what has become known to us in the twentieth century. Wheatley takes the reader on a mind-opening journey into the new science - the revolutionary discoveries in quantum physics, chaos theory, and molecular biology that are changing our understanding of the universe. And she applies these scientific concepts to offer new light on the fundamental issues of organizing work, people, and life, including: how can we find order in a chaotic world?; how is order different than control?; how can we create more participative, open, and adaptive organizations?; how can we reconcile individual autonomy and organizational control?; and what leads to organizational growth and self-renewal instead of decline and death?", "genre": ["Leadership", "Business", "Science", "Nonfiction", "Management", "Philosophy", "Education"], "author": "Margaret J.

And in San Francisco, a large earthquake occurred just after five in the morning on April 18--and that was just the beginning. The quake caused a conflagration that raged for the next three days, destroying much of the American West's greatest city. The fire, along with water damage and other indirect acts, proved more destructive than the earthquake itself, but insurance companies tried hard to dispute this fact since few people carried earthquake insurance. It was also the world's first major natural disaster to have been extensively photographed and covered by the media, and as a result, it left an indelible imprint on the mind of the entire nation. Though the epicenter of this marvelously constructed book is San Francisco, Winchester covers much more than just the disaster. He discusses how this particular quake led to greater scientific study of quakes in an attempt to understand the movements of the earth. Trained at Oxford University as a geologist, Winchester is well qualified to discuss the subject, and he clearly explains plate tectonics theory (first introduced in 1968) and the creation of the San Andreas Fault, along with the geologic exploration of the American West in the late 19th century and the evolution of technology used to measure and predict earthquakes. He also covers the social and political shifts caused by the disaster, such as the way that Pentecostalists viewed the quake as a message of divine approval and used it to recruit new members into the church, and the rise in the local Chinese population. With many records destroyed in the fire, there was no way to distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, and thus many more Chinese were granted citizenship than would have otherwise been. Filled with eyewitness accounts, vivid descriptions, crisp prose, and many delightful meanderings, A Crack in the Edge of the World is a thoroughly absorbing tale. --Shawn Carkonen", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Science", "Geology", "American History", "Audiobook", "Historical"], "author": "Simon Winchester", "rating": "3.79", "pages": "Audio"}, {"id": 1897808, "title": "Blood and Grits", "blurb": "A superb collection of nonfiction from Harry Crews--a profile of Charles Bronson, an encounter with hillbillies along the Appalachian Trail, life inside a traveling carnival and more.", "genre": ["Memoir", "Nonfiction", "Essays", "Short Stories", "Southern Gothic", "Travel"], "author": "Harry Crews", "rating": "4.15", "pages": "213"}, {"id": 1897894, "title": "Highland Vow", "blurb": "In book one of the new Scottish trilogy that captures the lives of the spirited daughters of the Murray brothers, Hannah Howell spins a passionate tale of a woman who risks everything to win the heart of the man who captures hers...HIGHLAND VOWTen years ago, young Elspeth Murray rescued a wounded young knight and lost her heart forever.

Born in 1922 in Coventry, England, he graduated from St. John's College, Oxford, in 1940 and then pursued a career as a librarian, becoming the librarian at the University of Hull in 1955. Although he led a retiring life and published infrequently, producing only one volume of poetry approximately every 10 years, Larkin was still considered one of the preeminent contemporary British poets. He is often associated with the Movement, a 1950s literary group that, through the use of colloquial language and common, everyday subjects, endeavored to create poetry that would appeal to the common reader. However, this association came about mainly because Larkin's poem Church Going, for which he first gained critical attention, was published in New Lines, an anthology of the Movement poets. In reality, his work, particularly his later poems, is not typical of the group. Larkin's published a total of only four volumes of poetry: The North Ship (1945), The Less Deceived (1955), The Whitsun Weddings (1964), and High Windows (1974). He also wrote two novels, Jill and A Girl in Winter, and published two volumes of prose, Required Writing and All That Jazz, a collection of his reviews of jazz records.

Instead of characterizing 'historicism' and 'secularization' as fundamental breaks with Europe's religious heritage, they are presented as complex cultural permutations with much continuity; for inherited theological patterns of interpreting experience determined to a large degree the conditions, possibilities and limitations of the forms of historical imagination realizable by nineteenth-century secular intellectuals. This point is made by examining the thought of the German theologian W. M. L. de Wette and that of the Swiss-German historian Jacob Burckhardt. Burckhardt's meeting with de Wette and his subsequent decision to study history over theology are interpreted as revealing moments in nineteenth-century intellectual history. By examining their encounter, its larger historical context, and the thought of both men, the book demonstrates the centrality of theological concerns and forms of knowledge in the emergence of modern, secular historical consciousness.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "History"], "author": "Thomas Albert Howard", "rating": "3.33", "pages": "264"}, {"id": 1898115, "title": "Explorer's Guide 50 Hikes in Ohio: Day Hikes  Backpacking Trips in the Buckeye State", "blurb": "He describes exiting walks in ten new trails that reflect his love ofhiking in special natural settings around the Buckeye State.

Natural decorating takes the long-term view--incorporating materials that age well and improve with the years, furnishings that bring comfort, simplicity, and practicality to the forefront. The richness of chalky colors and earth tones, the easygoing sympathy of wood, stone, and terra-cotta, the refined simplicity of linen and calico, muslin and raffia--all of these ingredients work together in effortless combinations for a natural sophistication and understated elegance that transcend the fickly whims of fashion.Natural Decorating is a practical guide to bringing natural style to every feature in an interior. Treatments for walls range from whitewash to organic stains to natural brickwork; floor finishes range from natural fibers to polished stone and limed wood; windows and doors receive curtains made of muslin, ticking, or parachute silk and feature wood blinds or etched glass panels; furnishings are a mix of styles and materials and covered in natural fabrics; display objects bring nature indoors to create simple finishing touches. All the projects provide essential information so that readers can assemble the look they want with ease.

For Chang, author of Wild Swans, this fact is an affront, not just to history, but to decency. Mao: The Unknown Story does not contain a formal dedication, but it is clear that Chang is writing to honor the millions of Chinese who fell victim to Mao's drive for absolute power in his 50-plus-year struggle to dominate China and the 20th-century political landscape. From the outset, Chang and Halliday are determined to shatter the myth of Mao, and they succeed with the force, not just of moral outrage, but of facts. The result is a book, more indictment than portrait, that paints Mao as a brutal totalitarian, a thug, who unleashed Stalin-like purges of millions with relish and without compunction, all for his personal gain. Through the authors' unrelenting lens even his would-be heroism as the leader of the Long March and father of modern China is exposed as reckless opportunism, subjecting his charges to months of unnecessary hardship in order to maintain the upper hand over his rival, Chang Kuo-tao, an experienced military commander.  Using exhaustive research in archives all over the world, Chang and Halliday recast Mao's ascent to power and subsequent grip on China in the context of global events. Sino-Soviet relations, the strengths and weakness of Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese invasion of China, World War II, the Korean War, the disastrous Great Leap Forward, the vicious Cultural Revolution, the Vietnam War, Nixon's visit, and the constant, unending purges all, understandably, provide the backdrop for Mao's unscrupulous but invincible political maneuverings and betrayals. No one escaped unharmed. Rivals, families, peasants, city dwellers, soldiers, and lifelong allies such as Chou En-lai were all sacrificed to Mao's ambition and paranoia. Appropriately, the authors' consciences are appalled. Their biggest fear is that Mao will escape the global condemnation and infamy he deserves. Their astonishing book will go a long way to ensure that the pendulum of history will adjust itself accordingly. --Silvana Tropea    10 Second Interview: A Few Words with Jung Chang and Jon Halliday[image] Q: From idea to finished book, how long did Mao: The Unknown Story take to research and write? A: Over a decade. Q: What was your writing process like? How did you two collaborate on this project? A: The research shook itself out by language. Jung did all the Chinese-language research, and Jon did the other languages, of which Russian was the most important, as Mao had a long-term intimate relationship with Stalin. After our research trips around the world, we would work in our separate studies in London. We would then rendezvous at lunch to exchange discoveries. Q: Do you have any thoughts about how the book is, or will be received in China? Did that play a part in your writing of the book? A: The book is banned in China, because the current Communist regime is fiercely perpetuating the myth of Mao. Today Mao's portrait and his corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, and the regime declares itself to be Mao's heir. The government blocked the distribution of an issue of The Far Eastern Economic Review, and told the magazine's owners, Dow Jones, that this was because that issue contained a review of our book. The regime also tore the review of our book out of The Economist magazine that was going to (very restricted) newsstands. We are not surprised that the book is banned. The regime's attitude had no influence on how we wrote the book. We hope many copies will find their way into China. Q: What is the one thing you hope readers get from your book? A: Mao was responsible for the deaths of well over 70 million Chinese in peacetime, and he was bent on dominating the world. As China is today emerging as an economic and military power, the world can never regard it as a benign force unless Beijing rejects Mao and all his legacies. We hope our book will help push China in this direction by telling the truth about Mao.   Breakdown of a BIG Book: 5 Things You'll Learn from Mao: The Unknown Story  1. Mao became a Communist at the age of 27 for purely pragmatic reasons: a job and income from the Russians. 2. Far from organizing the Long March in 1934, Mao was nearly left behind by his colleagues who could not stand him and had tried to oust him several times. The aim of the March was to link up with Russia to get arms. The Reds survived the March because Chiang Kai-shek let them, in a secret horse-trade for his son and heir, whom Stalin was holding hostage in Russia. 3. Mao grew opium on a large scale. 4. After he conquered China, Mao's over-riding goal was to become a superpower and dominate the world: Control the Earth, as he put it. 5. Mao caused the greatest famine in history by exporting food to Russia to buy nuclear and arms industries: 38 million people were starved and slave-driven to death in 1958-61. Mao knew exactly what was happening, saying: half of China may well have to die.", "genre": ["History", "Biography", "China", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "Asia", "Biography Memoir"], "author": "Jung Chang", "rating": "3.79", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 1900133, "title": "Srimad-Bhagavatam: Bhagavata Purana (18 Vol. Set)", "blurb": "Srimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana) is a virtual encyclopedia of yoga, meditation and the mystic arts. it brings together in one complete source information that previously took hundreds of books to explain.

Haiku consist of three lines & the waka has five lines, in contrast to the symmetrical pairings typical of western poetry. Asymmetry is a prized characteristic of Japanese aesthetics, along with movement & change. There is another poetic form, the renga, a series of linked short poems, written by a group of poets working together. They respond to each other's work within a set of generally understood conventions. Experts claim that it takes decades to master all the elements that go into making a renga. In Monkey's Raincoat there are four sections, or kasen, titled Winter Moon, Summer Rain, Autumn Cricket, & Grass & Plum. Images in a renga are always organized around a theme &, along with the seasons, other popular themes may be organized in subtle groupings such as 'things that rise' (mist, smoke, haze). An old Zen saying expresses the aim of renga poets: to be inside the poem creating it rather than standing outside it as creators: Entering the forest does not disturb a blade of grass/Entering the water does not/create a ripple. Monkey's Raincoat came about in 1690 when the poet Basho & a friend, Otokuni, made a trip to the capital city, Edo (Tokyo). The two invited six other poets to help them celebrate the occasion by composing a renga. As the basho, Basho wrote the lead verses. Let's squeeze the juice from our bones, he enthused. Why A monkey? Some answers suggest themselves. Buddhism refers to 'Monkey Mind' to describe the way our thoughts flit from one idea to another without taking time to fully explore them. This is likened to the way a monkey swings from tree to tree, tearing off pieces of fruit & throwing them away after a taste. Pliny, the Roman scholar, also compared the monkey to humans, noting similarities of behavior centuries before zoologists began their investigations. In western lore, allegories of the five senses often represent the taste sense by a monkey eating fruit. Medieval bestiaries, popular catalogs of animal information, often depict monkeys in a negative way, as tho those similarities cause us discomfort. Surely monkeys are not to blame for their relationship to us or for being a mirror of our own traits. The renga has been compared to the verse debates conducted by medieval troubadours. Called partumens, these debates provided entertainment for aristocratic gatherings. At about the same time in Japan, Lady Murasaki in her masterpiece The Tale of Genji described the court members passing the time by making a renga. It would be the great poet Basho (1644-1694) who transformed the renga from a game to a profound art. Basho came from a modest background but, as a dedicated student, he became learned in poetry, Taoism, & Buddhism, especially Zen. He spent long periods in seclusion, alternating his monastic bent with the travels that inspired his best-known verses in The Narrow Road to the Deep North. Basho was also sought after as a teacher & the other poets who contributed to Monkey's Raincoat were members of the Basho School. They included Fuminkani (a doctor), the devoted disciple Korai (who trained to be a military officer before choosing poetry) & Yasui (a rich merchant & government official). The poetry of Monkey's Raincoat is enjoyable on several levels: as a journey through the changing seasons, as a picture of life & love in the Edo Period & as a fine example of a subtle poetic form.", "genre": ["Poetry", "Japanese Literature"], "author": "Matsuo Bash\u014d", "rating": "3.60", "pages": "107"}, {"id": 1900720, "title": "Mischief In The Mountains", "blurb": "s/t: Strange Tales of Vermont & Vermonters.

Over 80 percent of the population have experienced the sense of being stared at. Conversely, most people have found they can make others uneasy by looking at them, even from behind. Recent experiments have provided hugely significant evidence for the reality of this sense. Somehow our intentions, and our attention, reach out to touch what we are looking at. Our minds are not confined to our brains. Once the influence of the mind is admitted to extend beyond the head, other well-known but seemingly mysterious phenomena begin to make sense, such as telepathy, phantom limbs and mind over matter effects. Sheldrake shows that telepathy depends on social bonds. He traces its evolution from the connections between members of animal groups such as flocks, schools and packs. In the modern world telepathy occurs most commonly just before telephone calls. He summarizes startling new experimental evidence for the reality of telephone telepathy, and shows how readers can do tests for themselves. Drawing on his own experiments and extensive research, Sheldrake puts the overwhelming evidence for these unexplained abilities in the context of what he", "genre": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Spirituality", "Paranormal", "Philosophy", "Metaphysics"], "author": "Rupert Sheldrake", "rating": "3.78", "pages": "372"}, {"id": 1901992, "title": "The Great Shakespeare Fraud: The Strange, True Story of William-Henry Ireland", "blurb": "William-Henry Ireland, at only nineteen, perpetrated the greatest Shakespeare forgery ever attempted.

In this true crime history, Patricia Pierce uncovers drama, pathos, scandal and ultimately tragedy, in a tale which began with a 'dull-witted' youth longing for his father's love and grew to involve a host of famous names from the playwright Sheridan to the Prince of Wales, Mrs. Siddons and James Boswell. Brought up in late eighteenth-century London, William-Henry was the son of Samuel Ireland, a collector and dealer in engravings. Fed on a daily diet of Shakespeare - whom Samuel regarded as 'a divinity' - William-Henry fell upon a unique method for winning his father's love and approval - forgery. Beginning with a deed 'signed' by Shakespeare, William-Henry followed this with a rapid succession of poems, letters and even an entirely new play, Vortigern. His success was phenomenal. James Boswell knelt to kiss 'the relics of Shakespeare', eminent clergyman Dr. Joseph Warton proclaimed 'Shakespeare's Profession of Faith' to be better than anything in either the church service or the litany, and Sheridan agreed to stage Vortigern.Yet the play marked the beginning of the end for the great Shakespeare forger. Staged two days after the expert Edmond Malone irrefutably exposed the forgeries, the esteemed actors were greeted with hoots of derision during Vortigern's single performance.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History"], "author": "Patricia Pierce", "rating": "3.76", "pages": "273"}, {"id": 1902035, "title": "Give Those Nymphs Some Hooters", "blurb": "Firing torpedoes into the reputation of Donald Trump, the latest Doonesbury collection targets the Trump Princess where commode artist J.J.
