This book is the first comprehensive study of his work.Gregory Elliott gives a dramatic view of the emergence of New Left theory in response to the degeneration of social democracy in the West and Communism in the East. As he traces the evolution of Anderson's thought - arguably the most brilliantly original and ambitiously wide-ranging body of Marxist historical revision produced in a generation - Elliott also sketches the collective career of New Left Review, itself one of the most influential international journals of the postwar period.Drawing on a wealth of material, Elliott identifies the enduring influence on Anderson of such figures as Isaac Deutscher and Antonio Gramsci. He also provides a detailed exposition and critique of Anderson's writings on politics and culture - whether English exceptionalism or European Marxism, Louis Althusser or E. P. Thompson, Gramsci or Francis Fukayama, the fate of Communism or the future of capitalism.This first full reconstruction of Anderson's distinguished career provides an overview of the evolution of the British New Left since 1956 and reveals a great deal about the vicissitudes of Marxist theory and political practice in the era of post-Stalinist Communism.

It is not geography that is the issue; Kashmir also guards the frontiers of ideology. If there was a glow of hope in the deepening shadows of a bitter partition, then it was Kashmir, whose people consciously rejected the false patriotism of fundamentalism and made common cause with secular India instead of theocratic Pakistan. Kashmir was, as Sheikh Abdullah said and Jawaharlal Nehru believed, a stabilising force for India. Why has that harmony disintegrated? Why has the promise been stained by the blood of rebellion? M.J. Akbar, the celebrated author of India: The Siege Within, Nehru: The Making of India, Riot After Riot and The Shade of Swords: Jihad and the Conflict between Islam and Christianity delves deep into the past for the roots of Kashmiriyat, the identity and culture that has blossomed within the ring of mountains for thousands of years. He records Kashmir's struggle in the century to first free itself from feudal oppression and then enter the world of modern India in 1947. Placing the mistakes and triumphs of those early, formative years in the perspective of history, the author goes on to explain how the 1980s have opened the way for Kashmir's hitherto marginalised secessionists. Both victory and defeat have their lessons; to forget either is to destablise the future. Kashmir and the mother country are inextricably linked. India cannot afford to be defeated in her Kashmir.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Cultural", "India", "Politics", "Asian Literature", "Indian Literature"], "author": "M.J.

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast.

I want to enlist art to question the mythical explanations of everyday life that take shape as an optimistic rationalism and to explore the relationships between individual consciousness, family life, and the culture of monopoly capitalism.Since the late 1960s, American artist Martha Rosler has produced seminal works in the fields of photography, performance, video, installation, critical writing, and theory. Committed to an art that engages a public beyond the confines of the art world, Rosler investigates how socioeconomic realities and political ideologies dominate ordinary life.

This beautiful book, with more than one hundred instructive illustrations, is revolutionary in its approach because it leads the cook infallibly from the buying and handling of raw ingredients, through each essential step of a recipe, to the final creation of a delicate confection.It breaks down the classic cuisine into a logical sequence of themes and variations rather than presenting an endless and diffuse catalogue of recipes; the focus is on key recipes that form the backbone of French cookery and lend themselves to an infinite number of elaborations bound to increase anyone's culinary repertoire.It adapts classical techniques, wherever possible, to modern American conveniences.It shows Americans how to buy products, from any supermarket in the U.S.A., that reproduce the exact taste and texture of the French ingredients: equivalent meat cuts, for example; the right beans for a cassoulet; the appropriate fish and shellfish for a bouillabaisse.It offers suggestions for just the right accompaniment to each dish, including proper wines.

Is science objective, a disinterested reflection of reality, as Karl Popper and his followers believed? Or is it subjective, a social construction, as Thomas Kuhn and his students maintained? Into the fray comes Mystery of Mysteries, an enlightening inquiry into the nature of science, using evolutionary theory as a case study.Michael Ruse begins with such colorful luminaries as Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) and Julian Huxley (brother of novelist Aldous and grandson of T. H. Huxley, Darwin's bulldog ) and ends with the work of the English game theorist Geoffrey Parker--a microevolutionist who made his mark studying the mating strategies of dung flies--and the American paleontologist Jack Sepkoski, whose computer-generated models reconstruct mass extinctions and other macro events in life's history. Along the way Ruse considers two great popularizers of evolution, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, as well as two leaders in the field of evolutionary studies, Richard Lewontin and Edward O. Wilson, paying close attention to these figures' cultural commitments: Gould's transplanted Germanic idealism, Dawkins's male-dominated Oxbridge circle, Lewontin's Jewish background, and Wilson's southern childhood. Ruse explicates the role of metaphor and metavalues in evolutionary thought and draws significant conclusions about the cultural impregnation of science. Identifying strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the science wars, he demonstrates that a resolution of the objective and subjective debate is nonetheless possible.\n...more", "genre": ["Science", "Philosophy"], "author": "Michael Ruse", "rating": "4.04", "pages": "296"}, {"id": 202058, "title": "Spanish Verb Drills", "blurb": "All those who seriously want to speak or write Spanish well must acquire a thorough knowledge of its verb system.

Now, in Flyboys, Bradley returns to World War II and an extraordinary-and totally unknown-true story of courage.\nOver the remote Pacific island of Chichi Jima, nine American flyers-Navy and Marine pilots sent to bomb Japanese communications towers there-were shot down. One of those nine was miraculously rescued by a U.S. Navy submarine. The others were captured by Japanese soldiers on Chichi Jima and held prisoner. Then they disappeared. When the war was over, the American government, along with the Japanese, covered up everything that had happened on Chichi Jima. The records of a top-secret military tribunal were sealed, the lives of the eight Flyboys were erased, and the parents, brothers, sisters, and sweethearts they left behind were left to wonder.Flyboys reveals for the first time ever the extraordinary story of those men. Bradley's quest for the truth took him from dusty attics in American small towns, to untapped government archives containing classified documents, to the heart of Japan, and finally to Chichi Jima itself. What he discovered was a mystery that dated back far before World War II-back 150 years, to America's westward expansion and Japan's first confrontation with the western world.Bradley brings into vivid focus these brave young men who went to war for their country, and through their lives he also tells the larger story of two nations in a hellish war. With no easy moralizing, Bradley presents history in all its savage complexity, including the Japanese warrior mentality that fostered inhuman brutality and the U.S. military strategy that justified attacks on millions of civilians. And, after almost sixty years of mystery, Bradley finally reveals the fate of the eight American Flyboys, all of whom would ultimately face a moment and a decision that few of us can even imagine.Flyboys is a story of war and horror but also of friendship and honor. It is about how we die, and how we live-including the tale of the Flyboy who escaped capture, a young Navy pilot named George H. W. Bush who would one day become president of the United States.A masterpiece of historical narrative, Flyboys will change forever our understanding of the Pacific war and the very things we fight for.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "World War II", "War", "War", "Military Fiction", "Military", "Military History", "Biography", "Aviation", "Historical", "North American Hi...", "American History"], "author": "James D.

Two years, forty pounds, sixty-seven thousand dollars, and an excruciating series of surgeries later, Mary Jane emerges as Jahne Moore - thin, gorgeous, and ready for the big time.

But a horror from the past, long believed vanquished, returned with devastating fury. And when the battle against the bloodthirsty Sorceresses of the Coven was finally won, victory was not without its price. Now, the royal palace lies in ruins; the king and queen, the royal guard, and the Directorate of Wizards are dead; the land is lawless; and Prince Tristan\u2014 forced by the Coven to murder his father, the King\u2014is a wanted man.In a cavernous underground labyrinth, once headquarters of the wizards\u2019 council, Tristan has taken refuge with his sister, Shailiha, her infant daughter, the wizard Wigg\u2014the lone surviving member of the Directorate\u2014and the crippled wizard Faegan, returned from self-imposed exile in the forest of Shadowood. Together they face the daunting task of restoring order to Eutracia and winning back the allegiance of her subjects. But suddenly, even these challenges pale beside a truly terrifying turn of events. The sacred jewel that is the source of all magic has inexplicably begun to lose its power. Without its age-old enchantment to sustain their spells, the immortal wizards will perish . . . and magic will vanish from Eutracia forever.At the same time, a mysterious and ruthless mercenary has declared a bounty upon the head of Prince Tristan. And an army of wizards on a mission to rid Eutracia of monsters created by the Coven has fallen prey to an insidious breed of creatures\u2014beings that can only have sprung from forbidden use of malevolent magic. With time and their powers dwindling, Wigg and Faegan desperately seek to discover who, or what, has succeeded the dead Sorceresses in laying siege to Eutracia.

And it is Tristan who will be thrust into the ultimate battle\u2014for his life, his land, and the course of his destiny.From the Hardcover edition.", "genre": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Epic Fantasy", "Science Fiction"], "author": "Robert Newcomb", "rating": "3.57", "pages": "514"}, {"id": 202480, "title": "Rabbit-Proof Fence: A True Story", "blurb": "The film Rabbit-Proof Fence is based on this true account of Doris Pilkington's mother Molly, who as a young girl led her two sisters on an extraordinary 1,600 kilometre walk home.

More importantly, the plurality of perspectives here represented suggests that Merleau-Ponty's work has the potential to transcend the divide between continental and analytic (or Anglo-American) philosophy, two traditions that have seemed far more in conflict than communication. As the essays in this volume show, both sides of the divide have everything to gain from engaging the work of one of the twentieth century's most penetrating and provocative philosophers.It is in this spirit of overcoming the polemics from both sides of the rift that editors Lawrence Hass and Dorothea Olkowski offer this collection on very contemporary topics. Divided into seven sections, sixteen articles discuss Merleau-Ponty's contributions to the study of intentionality, cognition and perception, philosophy of the natural and social sciences, ethics, political thought, ontology and genealogy, and philosophy of sexuality and love.Through this multiplicity and interplay of different orientations, the editors hope to inspire not only a sensitive rereading of this most extraordinary philosopher but also an alternative model for philosophical thought and conversation beyond the divide.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Lawrence Hass", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "382"}, {"id": 203373, "title": "501 Essential Backgammon Problems", "blurb": "This comprehensive backgammon book challenges the reader with 501 essential problems to transform him into a thinking, aggressive pro-level player.

Harrison, a leading Indiana lawyer, became a Republican Party champion, even taking a leave from the Civil War to campaign for Lincoln. After a scandal-free term in the Senate-no small feat in the Gilded Age-the Republicans chose Harrison as their presidential candidate in 1888. Despite losing the popular vote, he trounced the incumbent, Grover Cleveland, in the electoral college.In contrast to standard histories, which dismiss Harrison's presidency as corrupt and inactive, Charles W. Calhoun sweeps away the stereotypes of the age to reveal the accomplishments of our twenty-third president. With Congress under Republican control, he exemplified the activist president, working feverishly to put the Party's planks into law and approving the first billion-dollar peacetime budget. But the Democrats won Congress in 1890, stalling his legislative agenda, and with the First Lady ill, his race for reelection proceeded quietly. (She died just before the election.)

In Double Vision, philosopher and literary critic Tzachi Zamir argues that there are more things in Hamlet than are dreamt of--or at least conceded--by most philosophers. Making an original and persuasive case for the philosophical value of literature, Zamir suggests that certain important philosophical insights can be gained only through literature. But such insights cannot be reached if literature is deployed merely as an aesthetic sugaring of a conceptual pill. Philosophical knowledge is not opposed to, but is consonant with, the literariness of literature. By focusing on the experience of reading literature as literature and not philosophy, Zamir sets a theoretical framework for a philosophically oriented literary criticism that will appeal both to philosophers and literary critics. Double Vision is concerned with the philosophical understanding induced by the aesthetic experience of literature. Literary works can function as credible philosophical arguments--not ones in which claims are conclusively demonstrated, but in which claims are made plausible. Such claims, Zamir argues, are embedded within an experiential structure that is itself a crucial dimension of knowing. Developing an account of literature's relation to knowledge, morality, and rhetoric, and advancing philosophical-literary readings of Richard III, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, Hamlet, and King Lear, Zamir shows how his approach can open up familiar texts in surprising and rewarding ways.", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Tzachi Zamir", "rating": "4.50", "pages": "256"}, {"id": 203538, "title": "Brandchild: Inside the Minds of Today's Global Kids: Understanding Their Relationship with Brands", "blurb": "Tweens (8- to 14-year-olds) comprise a new type of audience.

Based on the world's most extensive study of tween attitudes and behaviors ever conducted, 'BRANDChild' is the first book to look in-depth at the phenomena behind global kids and their relationships with brands. Conducted by Millward Brown, the leading global market research agency, the BRANDchild survey involved several thousand kids from more than 70 cities in 15 countries (throughout Europe, Asia, the United States and South America). Several renowned experts including best-selling author Patricia B. Seybold ('Customers.com') share their unique views on kids' trends and fascinating marketing techniques. 'BRANDChild' summarizes this research, as well as decades of experience from a variety of other sources on how to market to kids. It looks at their life priorities, hopes and dreams and reveals the true drivers of kids' trends by analyzing teen-minority groups, communities and clubs. Packed with practical advice on how to create kids' brands, including more than 50 previously unpublished case studies, 'BRANDchild' proposes new innovative ways of marketing to this young audience.

K. Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy explore why, despite unbounded opportunities for innovation, companies still can't satisfy customers and sustain profitable growth. The explanation for this apparent paradox lies in recognizing the structural changes brought about by the convergence of industries and technologies; ubiquitous connectivity and globalization; and, as a consequence, the evolving role of the consumer from passive recipient to active co-creator of value. Managers need a new framework for value creation. Increasingly, individual customers interact with a network of firms and consumer communities to co-create value. No longer can firms autonomously create value. Neither is value embedded in products and services per se. Products are but an artifact around which compelling individual experiences are created. As a result, the focus of innovation will shift from products and services to experience environments that individuals can interact with to co-construct their own experiences. These personalized co-creation experiences are the source of unique value for consumers and companies alike.In this emerging opportunity space, companies must build new strategic capital\u2014a new theory on how to compete.

It concerned a very optimistic young boy who happened upon a huge pile of horse manure and began digging excitedly. When someone asked him what he was doing covered in muck, the foolish boy answered brightly, \u2018There must be a pony in here somewhere!\u2019\u201d \u2014From the PrologueIf you\u2019re wondering what happened after \u201ca company without assets acquired a company without a clue,\u201d as Kara Swisher wryly writes, it\u2019s time to crack open this trenchant book about the doomed merger of America Online and Time Warner. On a quest to discover how the deal of the century became the messiest merger in history, Swisher delivers a rollicking narrative and a keen analysis of this debacle that is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand what it all means for the digital future. Packed with new revelations and on-the-record interviews with key players, it is the first detailed examination of the merger\u2019s aftermath and also looks forward to what is coming next.It certainly has not been a pretty picture so far\u2014with $100 billion in losses, a sinking stock price, employees in revolt, and lawsuits galore. As Swisher writes, \u201cIt is hard not to feel a bit queasy about the whole sorry mess...It felt a bit like I was watching someone fall down a flight of stairs in slow motion, and every bump and thump made me wince. It made me reassess old ideas and wonder what I had gotten wrong. And it left me deeply confused as to what had happened and, more important, what was coming next.\u201dFor Swisher, finding the answers to what went awry is important because she remains a staunch believer in the digital future\u2014maybe not in the AOL Time Warner merger, but in the essential idea at the heart of it that someday the distinction of old and new media will no longer exist. Borrowing from Winston Churchill, Swisher calls it \u201cthe end of the beginning\u201d of the digital revolution. \u201cBy that, I mean that it is from the ashes of this bust that the really important companies of the next era will emerge. And that evolution will, I believe, be shaped by what happened\u2014and what is happening now\u2014at AOL Time Warner.\u201dTo figure it all out, Swisher takes her reader on a journey that begins with a portrait of two wildly different corporate cultures and businesses that somehow came to believe, in the crucible of the red-hot Internet era, that they could successfully join forces and achieve unprecedented growth and success. When the merger was announced in early 2000, the irresistible combination was hailed as the new paradigm and its executives\u2014Steve Case, Jerry Levin, Bob Pittman\u2014as popular icons of the future. But after the boom so spectacularly turned to bust and the visions of New Media Supremacy lay in ruins, Swisher searches for clues about where the merger went wrong and who is to blame.More important, she looks to the future of both AOL Time Warner and the Internet as she seeks to answer the key question that the noise of the disaster has all but drowned out. Will the demise of the AOL Time Warner merger be the final and inevitable chapter of the dot-com debacle or will it herald a new paradigm altogether? This book, then, is a primer for the time to come, using the story of the AOL Time Warner merger as the vehicle to show the troubled journey into the future.\u201cSwisher narrates human foible and brilliance, a train-wreck tale brightened by plenty of personality\u2014including her own, sparkling through in laugh-out-loud observations on almost every page.\u201d \u2014Boston Globe\u201cSwisher displays a finely honed hogwash detector and maps AOL\u2019s inevitable fall with the perfect amount of cynicism and whimsy.\u201d \u2014Newsday\u201cSwisher delivers a readable account of the gigantic merger and why it didn\u2019t work.

In this vein, much of the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) literature subscribes to the idea that the Information Age will witness a transformation in the very nature of war. In this book, David Lonsdale puts that notion to the test.Using a range of contexts, the book sets out to look at whether the classical Clausewitzian theory of the nature of war will retain its validity in this new age. The analysis covers the character of the future battlespace, the function of command, and the much-hyped concept of Strategic Information Warfare. Finally, the book broadens its perspective to examine the nature of 'Information Power' and its implications for geopolitics. Through an assessment of both historical and contemporary case studies (including the events following September 11 and the recent war in Iraq), the author concludes that although the future will see many changes to the conduct of warfare, the nature of war, as given theoretical form by Clausewitz, will remain essentially unchanged.\n...more", "genre": ["War", "Military Fiction"], "author": "David J.

With The Sketch Book, Irving became a world-famous writer, lionized in French and English society and admired by Scott and Byron. His success and his fascination with folklore traditions prompted him to travel in Europe in search of material for further tales. He went on to transform what he found into an array of short pieces that sparkle with humor, adventure, mystery, and romance. Written at the peak of his popularity, these three works reveal Irving\u2019s remarkable diversity, his skill at adapting European legends to his own style, and the talent for entertainment that made him America\u2019s first literary celebrity.Bracebridge Hall (1822) was published, like The Sketch Book, under the pseudonym Geoffrey Crayon, and centers on an English manor, its inhabitants, and the tales they tell. Interspersed with witty, evocative sketches of country life among the English nobility is the well-known tale \u201cThe Stout Gentleman\u201d and stories based on English, French, and Spanish folklore, vividly recounted with Irving\u2019s inimitable blend of elegance and colloquial dash. They include \u201cDolph Heyliger,\u201d the story of a New Yorker who encounters a haunted house, ghosts, and a buried treasure, and its famous sequel, \u201cThe Storm Ship,\u201d an American version of the legend of the Flying Dutchman.Tales of a Traveller (1824), written after a year-long stay in Germany, is a pivotal work in Irving\u2019s career, marking his last experiment with fiction before he turned to the writing of history, biography, and adaptation of folktales. Irving felt his new stories to be \u201csome of the best things I have ever written. They may not be as highly finished as some of my former writings, but they are touched off with a freer spirit, and are more true to life.\u201d Arranged in four sections, the miscellany of short fiction reveals elements of comedy and melodrama new to Irving\u2019s work. The first three groups of stories have a European background, while the final five stories, supposedly \u201cfound among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker,\u201d are set in New York and feature pirates and buried treasure.The Alhambra (1832) was inspired by Irving\u2019s stay during the spring and summer of 1829 at the ancient Moorish palace in Granada, which he called \u201cone of the most remarkable, romantic, and delicious spots in the world.\u201d This rich compendium of tales, deftly interwoven with historical accounts and picturesque sketches, was assembled from Spanish and Moorish folklore, history, guidebooks, and anecdotes of Irving\u2019s experiences among the local residents. The forty-nine pieces range from stories based on Granada\u2019s colorful history to graceful vignettes of its contemporary scene, from romantic descriptions of the local architecture and terrain to medieval tales of the supernatural.", "genre": ["Classics", "American", "Literature", "Travel", "Fiction", "Short Stories"], "author": "Washington Irving", "rating": "4.03", "pages": "1104"}, {"id": 204870, "title": "Dragon Dance", "blurb": "Simon and Brad's fireball adventures take them to ancient China where they are exposed to incredible practices of mind control.\nSimon and Brad's fireball adventures take them to ancient China where they are exposed to incredible practices of mind control.\n...more", "genre": ["Science Fiction", "Novels", "Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Adventure", "Literature", "20th Century", "Fiction", "Childrens"], "author": "John Christopher", "rating": "3.47", "pages": "139"}, {"id": 204904, "title": "Shadow of Paradise", "blurb": "Begun in 1939, barely four months after the close of the Spanish Civil War, these poems by the Nobel Laureate poet Vicente Aleixandre were written during a period of hardship and despair.

Along the way, movements for social justice have created a wide array of pamphlets, broadsides, newsletters, newspapers, and even glossy magazines. In People's Movements, People's Press, Bob Ostertag brings this hidden history to light, examining the publications of the abolitionist, woman suffrage, gay and lesbian, and environmental movements, as well as the underground GI press during the Vietnam War. This fascinating story takes us from the sparse, privately owned media environment of the nineteenth century to the corporate media saturation of the present.Within these publications, we find powerful debates about the direction of a movement; impassioned cries for rights and civil liberties; lonely voices reaching out to others after being alienated by the mainstream press and the unaccepting world around them; and demands that now seem surprisingly reasonable but were at one time quite revolutionary. With both plain language and rigorous scholarship, Ostertag tells the story not only of the publications but the many colorful characters who created them.The story of the social justice movement press is deeply intertwined with the story of the movements themselves. In fact, Ostertag shows how reliance on the printed word fundamentally shaped what we now know as social movements. People's Movements, People's Press, then, offers a new view\u2014from the ground up\u2014of social transformation in America and raises the question of how social movements will change as they move from print to the Internet as their primary means of communication.As large corporations take over every media outlet available, People's Movements, People's Press reminds us of the great value and historical importance of independent, activist-driven media.", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History"], "author": "Bob Ostertag", "rating": "3.71", "pages": "240"}, {"id": 205801, "title": "Best Newspaper Writing 2004: The Nation's Best Journalism", "blurb": "A series now in its 25th year, Best Newspaper Writing 2004 celebrates the winners of the ASNE Distinguished Writing Awards.

These individuals:- Understand the value of you by translating their knowledge and experience into action, building their personal value over each phase of their career- Practice benevolent leadership by not clawing their way to the top but by being carried there- Solve the permission paradox, the dilemma of not being able to get a job without experience and not getting the experience without the job- Differentiate using the 20/80 principle of performance by storming past their defined jobs to create breakthrough ideas and deliver unexpected impact- Do not micromanage their careers, but macromanage them by gravitating toward the things they are best at and have a passion for, and working with people they like and respectNo one manages your career for you. But with Citrin and Smith as your guide, you'll be able to understand--and act on--the root causes of success. And what better source for strategic career advice than Spencer Stuart, the firm that over the past ten years has conducted more than 60 percent of the searches for Fortune 1000 CEOs?\n...more", "genre": ["Business", "Nonfiction", "Leadership", "Self Help", "Business", "Management"], "author": "James M.

The latest victim, nature photographer Cliff Benson, was brutally killed while camping in the mountains.With little hard evidence to go on, Sheriff Les Collins closes the case, chalking it up to the work of a rogue bear - just like so many other unsolvable deaths and disappearances that have plagued Hyde River over the years.But wildlife biologist Steve Benson refuses to let the cause of his brother's death remain a mystery. He is joined in his investigation by attractive, auburn-haired Sheriff's Deputy Tracy Ellis. She has grown up in Hyde River. She's seen enough things swept under the rug by local law enforcement to know that something's amiss.The harder townsfolk are pressed for information, the more they close ranks, as if sworn to secrecy. It is only when Steve gains access to old letters and diaries of the town's forefathers that he begins to peel away the layers of mystery surrounding Hyde River. Steve and Tracy are drawn closer to each other and to the town's terrible secret. What they discover is a predator more terrifying than anything they had imagined and a town in the grip of unspeakable evil.Once again best-selling author Frank Peretti has crafted a spellbinding novel filled with tension and suspense crescendoing to a peak of raw-edged terror that will keep you breathless.

As a teenager he started to explore a set of nettlesome geometrical problems, including Euclid's parallel postulate, and in 1832 he published a brilliant twenty-four-page paper that eventually shook the foundations of the 2000-year-old tradition of Euclidean geometry. Bolyai's Appendix (published as just that--an appendix to a much longer mathematical work by his father) set up a series of mathematical proposals whose implications would blossom into the new field of non-Euclidean geometry, providing essential intellectual background for ideas as varied as the theory of relativity and the work of Marcel Duchamp. In this short book, Jeremy Gray explains Bolyai's ideas and the historical context in which they emerged, were debated, and were eventually recognized as a central achievement in the Western intellectual tradition.

Finally, as a corrective and a major challenge to deep ecology, which has tended to valorize the scientific approach to nature, Heidegger's work provides a sophisticated basis for showing the primacy of the poetic in the task of learning to inhabit the earth rightly.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Environment"], "author": "Bruce V.

To apprehend Chekhov means seeing how Chekhov sees, and the author's remarkable vision is understood as deriving from his occupational or professional training and identity. But we have failed to register, let alone understand, just what a central concern for Chekhov himself, and how deeply problematic, were precisely issues of seeing and being seen.--from the IntroductionMichael C. Finke explodes a century of critical truisms concerning Chekhov's objective eye and what being a physician gave him as a writer in a book that foregrounds the deeply subjective and self-reflexive aspects of his fiction and drama. In exploring previously unrecognized seams between the author's life and his verbal art, Finke profoundly alters and deepens our understanding of Chekhov's personality and behaviors, provides startling new interpretations of a broad array of Chekhov's texts, and fleshes out Chekhov's simultaneous pride in his identity as a physician and devastating critique of turn-of-the-century medical practices and ideologies.Seeing Chekhov is essential reading for students of Russian literature, devotees of the short story and modern drama, and anyone interested in the intersection of literature, psychology, and medicine.\n...more", "genre": ["Biography"], "author": "Michael C.

Here, for the first time, he tells the story of his lifelong obsession with football, in an honest and revealing book which captures the extraordinary camaraderie, the soul-destroying tensions and the high-octane thrills of the modern game as never before.Born in the Liverpool suburb of Huyton in 1980, Steven first joined Liverpool as a YTS trainee and played his first game for the first team aged just 18. His career has gone from strength to strength ever since and he is now the team's captain and its lynchpin. Liverpool's incredible comeback in the Champions' League final in Istanbul in May 2005, recovering from a 3-goal deficit against AC Milan to win on penalties, is testament to the amazing power Gerrard has over his team. His presence on the pitch is a force to be reckoned with and places him amongst the very first rank of players in the world.A relatively private figure, Steven has rarely spoken out in public. Now, his legions of fans will be allowed an intimate glimpse of what makes their hero tick. He speaks for the first time about the torturous will-he-won't-he Chelsea rumours and his undying passion for Liverpool. We experience first-hand the highs of winning in Istanbul and elsewhere, as well as the occasional lows of being parted from his much-loved family and friends.

Law's Empire is a full-length presentation of his theory of law that will be studied and debated--by scholars and theorists, by lawyers and judges, by students and political activists--for years to come.Dworkin begins with the question that is at the heart of the whole legal system: in difficult cases how do (and how should) judges decide what the law is? He shows that judges must decide hard cases by interpreting rather than simply applying past legal decisions, and he produces a general theory of what interpretation is--in literature as well as in law--and of when one interpretation is better than others. Every legal interpretation reflects an underlying theory about the general character of law: Dworkin assesses three such theories. One, which has been very influential, takes the law of a community to be only what the established conventions of that community say it is. Another, currently in vogue, assumes that legal practice is best understood as an instrument of society to achieve its goals. Dworkin argues forcefully and persuasively against both these views: he insists that the most fundamental point of law is not to report consensus or provide efficient means to social goals, but to answer the requirement that a political community act in a coherent and principled manner toward all its members. He discusses, in the light of that view, cases at common law, cases arising under statutes, and great constitutional cases in the Supreme Court, and he systematically demonstrates that his concept of political and legal integrity is the key to Anglo-American legal theory and practice.", "genre": ["Law", "Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "Academic", "Economics", "Reference"], "author": "Ronald Dworkin", "rating": "3.94", "pages": "470"}, {"id": 209390, "title": "Just in Case", "blurb": "After his younger brother narrowly avoids a serious fall, fifteen-year-old David Case realizes the fragility of life and senses impending doom.

On such issues as abortion, homosexuality, and women's rights, many religious Americans feel pulled between their personal beliefs and their need, as good citizens, to support individual rights. These circumstances, argues John Tomasi, raise new and pressing questions: Is liberalism as successful as it hopes in avoiding the imposition of a single ethical doctrine on all of society? If liberals cannot prevent the spillover of public values into nonpublic domains, how accommodating of diversity can a liberal regime actually be? To what degree can a liberal society be a home even to the people whose viewpoints it was formally designed to include?To meet these questions, Tomasi argues, the boundaries of political liberal theorizing must be redrawn. Political liberalism involves more than an account of justified state coercion and the norms of democratic deliberation. Political liberalism also implies a distinctive account of nonpublic social life, one in which successful human lives must be built across the interface of personal and public values. Tomasi proposes a theory of liberal nonpublic life. To live up to their own deepest commitments to toleration and mutual respect, liberals, he insists, must now rethink their conceptions of social justice, civic education, and citizenship itself. The result is a fresh look at liberal theory and what it means for a liberal society to function well.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "John Tomasi", "rating": "3.78", "pages": "184"}, {"id": 209447, "title": "Liar", "blurb": "Investigative reporting has its hazards, but trouble hits home for Irene Kelly when her estranged aunt is murdered--and Irene becomes the leading suspect.

THE WARREN BUFFETT PORTFOLIO will help you through the process of building a superior portfolio and managing the stocks going forward.  Building a concentrated portfolio is critical for investment success. THE WARREN BUFFETT PORTFOLIO introduces the next wave of investment strategy, called focus investing. A comprehensive investment strategy used with spectacular results by Buffett, focus investing directs investors to select a concentrated group of businesses by examining their management and financial positions as compared to their stock prices. A strategy that has historically outperformed the market, focus investing is based on the principle that a shareholder's return from owning a stock is ultimately determined by the economics of the underlying business.  Hagstrom explains in easy-to-understand terms exactly what focus investing is, how it works, and how it can be applied by any investor at any level of experience. He demonstrates how Buffett arranges his stocks in a focus portfolio and reveals why this is as responsible for his incredible returns as the individual stocks he picks. Ultimately, Hagstrom shows how to use this technique to build and manage a portfolio to achieve the best possible results.\n...more", "genre": ["Economics", "Finance", "Business", "Nonfiction", "Economics", "Finance", "Personal Finance", "Currency", "Money", "Biography", "Audiobook", "Self Help"], "author": "Robert G.

The authors, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, correspondents for The Economist, won the Financial Times/Booz Allen Hamilton Global Business Book Award on Strategy and Leadership for their previous collaboration, The Witch Doctors. In A Future Perfect, Micklethwait and Wooldridge expand their field of vision in order to analyze, demystify, and expose the global forces reshaping our world, and they detail both the challenge and the hidden promise those forces hold for individuals, businesses, and governments. Do businesses benefit from going global? Are we creating winner-take-all societies? Will globalization seal the triumph of junk culture? What will happen to individual careers? Gathering evidence from the shantytowns of Sao Paolo to the boardroom of General Electric, from the troubled Russia-Estonia border to the booming San Fernando Valley sex industry, Micklethwait and Wooldridge mount a powerful, witty, levelheaded defense of globalization. Along the way, the authors introduce us to the cosmocrats--the members of the elite business, information, and diplomatic class who are creating the new world order. They also identify the three engines of globalization and describe how people are managing and governing in an increasingly global era. As they did in The Witch Doctors, the authors also brilliantly puncture myths and conventional wisdom, separating false hopes from emerging realities.

Apprenticeship; III. The Great Struggle; IV. Daybreak. Martin Andersen Nexo (1869-1954) was born in the slums of Copenhagen into extreme poverty. He was the fourth of eleven children. His father, a stone mason, was an alcoholic and his mother was a daughter of a blacksmith. When he was eight, the family moved to the town of Nexo on the island of Bornholm, whose name he adopted in 1894 as his own. His breakthrough work, the Danish classic Pelle the Conqueror, appeared between 1906 (Part I) and 1910 (Part IV). It tells the story of Pelle, a poor boy, whose life in Part I shares much similarities with Nex\u00f8's. The great charm of the book lies in the fact that the writer knows the poor from within; he has not studied them as an outsider may, but has lived with them and felt with them, at once a participant and a keen-eyed spectator. He is no sentimentalist, and so rich is his imagination that he passes on rapidly from one scene to the next, sketching often in a few pages what another novelist would be content to work out into long chapters or whole volumes. His sympathy is of the widest, and he makes us see tragedies behind the little comedies, and comedies behind the little tragedies, of the seemingly sordid lives of the working people whom he loves.

Although to this day the CIA refuses to confirm or deny involvement, Rabe presents evidence that CIA funding, through a program run by the AFL-CIO, helped foment the labor unrest, race riots, and general chaos that led to Jagan's replacement in 1964. The political leader preferred by the United States, Forbes Burnham, went on to lead a twenty-year dictatorship in which he persecuted the majority Indian population.

However, the very specificity that lends itself so well to research and training has minimized the role of the therapeutic relationship, making it difficult for therapists to respond flexibly to different clinical situations. What is needed is an approach that focuses on the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic change, not just on interventions. In this practical and original book, two highly respected clinician-researchers integrate findings from cognitive psychology, infant developmental research, emotion theory, and relational therapy to show how change takes place in the interpersonal context of the therapeutic relationship and involves experiencing the self in new ways, not just altering behavior or cognitions. Making use of extensive clinical transcripts accompanied by moment-to-moment analyses of the change process, the authors illustrate the subtle interaction of cognitive and interpersonal factors. They show how therapy unfolds at three different levels-in fluctuations in the patient's world, in the therapeutic relationship, and in the therapist's inner experience-and provide clear guidelines for when to focus on a particular level. The result is a superb integration of cognitive and interpersonal approaches that will have a major impact on theory and practice. A Jason Aronson Book", "genre": ["Psychology"], "author": "Jeremy D.

Another of his ongoing characters, however, has remained at large--Henry Bech. In Bech at Bay, Updike revives his philandering Jewish American novelist for one last trip through that wringer we call the writer's life. Like his creator, Bech is getting on in years. And although age cannot wither his considerable sexual appetites nor custom stale his cantankerous charms, he is uncomfortably aware of his mortality. In the first episode, during a visit to pre-perestroika Czechoslovakia, the semi-obscure American author is taken to view Kafka's grave, and the sight gives him the willies: It all struck Bech as dumbfoundingly blunt and engimatic, banal and moving. Such blankness, such stony and peaceable reification, waits for us at the bottom of things. His own proximity to the bottom of things is what gives Bech at Bay an extra dose of sobriety. For the first time, Updike's ingratiating impersonation of a Jew--who shares the author's lapidary style, sizable nose, and not much else--is not only supremely amusing but moving. Which isn't to say that all is gloomy in Bechville. Updike keeps things breezy throughout, as his hero is seduced and subpoenaed, excoriated and honored, finally, with the Nobel Prize. Only once does the author lose his footing, with Bech Noir: this world-class nebbish just doesn't cut it as serial killer, and even the prose goes untypically to pot. But otherwise the book is a delight, venting all the nastiness about literary life that Updike always purges from his own more genteel (not to mention Gentile) persona. It's also an elegant meditation on literary being and nothingness. A character, we are told, suffers from the fear that he will become boring to the author, who will simply let him drop, without so much as a terminal illness or a dramatic tumble down the Reichenbach Falls in the arms of Professor Moriarty. For some years now, Bech had felt his author wanting to set him aside, to get him off the desk forever. Here Updike proves himself Nabokov's equal in the metafictional sweepstakes--and makes us hope that his doppelg\u00e4nger will get one last reprieve. --James Marcus\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Novels", "Literature", "American", "Short Stories", "The United States Of America", "Literature", "Humor"], "author": "John Updike", "rating": "3.69", "pages": null}, {"id": 213575, "title": "Course of Theoretical Physics: Vol. 4, Quantum Electrodynamics", "blurb": "In accordance with the general plan of this 'Course of Theoretical Physics', the present volume deals with relativistic quantum theory in the broad sense: the theory of all phenomena which depend upon the finite velocity of light, including the whole of the theory of radiation.\nIn accordance with the general plan of this 'Course of Theoretical Physics', the present volume deals with relativistic quantum theory in the broad sense: the theory of all phenomena which depend upon the finite velocity of light, including the whole of the theory of radiation.\n...more", "genre": ["Science", "Physics", "Textbooks", "Science", "Nonfiction"], "author": "L.D.

Host is effusive in his welcome to former roommate, that is. Girl and former roommate strip naked and get into bed, as host, terribly rattled, continues to chatter. (The chatter is absolutely fine.) The intruders move in permanently, and soon the host's old pictures and bits of sculpture are replaced by a huge, bright, modern abstract. And there are other innovations. As the action progresses, the roles of lover and leftover switch back and forth, and the girl, like the old bum in The Caretaker, tries to set the men against each other and succeeds. There are scenes at a beach, in a cafe, and at a bogus deathbed, and there is a duel, which is fought on a dark stage with lighted broken bottles. In the end we are, it seems, back where we started. But not quite. We have seen, if only for a moment, the rather pathetic, trembling animals who lie beneath the veneer of the shaved, powdered exteriors, and we know that it is not relief that will come to them\ufffdjust continuation.\n...more", "genre": ["Plays"], "author": "Harold Pinter", "rating": "3.35", "pages": "115"}, {"id": 213954, "title": "Public Life in Renaissance Florence", "blurb": "Covering the history of Renaissance Florence from the fourteenth century to the beginnings of the Medici duchy, Richard C.
