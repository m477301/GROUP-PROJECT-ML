In the past, community leaders and law enforcement officials have approached the problem, not as something that needs to be understood, but only as something to be gotten rid of. Rejecting that approach, James D. Vigil asserts that only by understanding the complex factors that give birth and persistence to gangs can gang violence be ended.Drawing on many years of experience in the barrios as a youth worker, high school teacher, and researcher, Vigil identifies the elements from which gangs spring: isolation from the dominant culture, poverty, family stress and crowded households, peer pressure, and the adolescent struggle for self-identity. Using interviews with actual gang members, he reveals how the gang often functions as parent, school, and law enforcement in the absence of other role models in the gang members' lives. And he accounts for the longevity of gangs, sometimes over decades, by showing how they offer barrio youth a sense of identity and belonging nowhere else available.", "genre": ["Crime"], "author": "James Diego Vigil", "rating": "4.25", "pages": "220"}, {"id": 1200002, "title": "L'uomo che guarda", "blurb": "De drie hoofdpersonen in deze roman staan in een ingewikkelde verhouding tot elkaar: Eduardo en Silvia, met elkaar getrouwd, wonen in bij de vader van Eduardo; in tegenstelling tot Eduardo een geslaagd wetenschapper.

Others leave their prey in bush culverts, aware that the possibility of discovery is remote and that when the rains come the evidence of their ghastly crime will be swept away, scattered on a riverbed, forever undetected.And then there are the murderers who leave their victims in hiding places in the belief that they will be discovered sooner or later, as if they want the world to know of their grisly handiwork.

First published in 1856, The Grammar of Ornament remains a design classic. Its inspiration came from the pioneering architect and designer Owen Jones. His observations of decorative art on his extensive travels in Europe and the Near East were employed to improve the poor quality of Western design. His goal was to change the Victorian habit of mixing elements from a wide variety of sources and applying this mix indiscriminately to buildings, graphic design, and products. His resulting study is a comprehensive analysis of a remarkable collection of styles of ornamental design -- from Ancient Egypt and Greece to Imperial China and Renaissance Italy. With its sumptuous illustrations, its detailed survey of individual cultures, and its manifesto of General Principles, it offered guidance to the designers of the future. In this new edition the designs are further illuminated by Iain Zaczek's perceptive commentaries. Hugely influential since its first publication, The Grammar of Ornament inspired great figures such as William Morris and Frank Lloyd Wright. Contemporary designers, entertained by the archaic charm of Jones's descriptions, are struck by the book's enduring relevance and its soundness regarding the essential principles of good design.\n...more", "genre": ["Art", "Design", "Nonfiction", "Reference", "Architecture", "Art", "Art History", "History", "Art", "Crafts"], "author": "Owen    Jones", "rating": "4.30", "pages": null}, {"id": 1200027, "title": "Dark Designs", "blurb": "A deliciously steamy gothic romance for fans of EL James and Sylvia DayRemy Davies is under pressure, as the designer for an opulent gothic wedding.

All the traditional dishes are here, many in their original robust versions and others cleverly lightened by German's new generation of chefs and home cooks. Potato salad, barely glossed with dressing, then greened with fresh chevil; sauerkraut teamed with cod; and pumpernickel reduced to crumbs and folded into an airy Bavarian cream are just a few of the creative new German dishes that nevertheless bow to tradition. A chapter on wine and beer by Lamart Elmore, former executive director of the German Wine Information Bureau, completes the picture of Germany's total gastronomic experience.Germany today is a land of contradictions, a land where meandering rivers run alongside autobahns, where castles and cuckoo clocks coexist easily with high tech, high fashion, and haute cuisine.

Yet in our familiarity with the Apostle Paul's words to his favorite church, we must be careful not to miss the deeper themes, says commentator R. Kent Hughes. Themes such as the robust fellowship and unity that Paul shared with the Christians at Philippi based on their mutual commitment to the gospel.Theirs was a partnership we rarely see today--between people who were bound together in the great cause of unfurling the gospel flag in cities, countries, and other cultures--undergirded by Paul's central call to let their manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ. It was a joyous cause, a unity, a manner of life that should be ours as well.The characteristics of such true Christian conduct and spirit are detailed throughout this epistle and this commentary, with every aspect ultimately centering in Christ. Hughes's faithful exposition and application will reveal how much Philippians is about Christ and about people in Christ Jesus, as well as about people who are in the joyful fellowship of the gospel together because they are in Christ.

Whenever Shiva or Adishakti come to Earth in human form, they are fated to marry each other again--but that\u2019s no guarantee that all will go smoothly with their courtship. In this story Adishakti comes to Earth as the mountain princess Parvati, who has her work cut out for her when she tries to win the affections of Shiva. Shiva spends all his time meditating on a remote mountainside in the Himalayas and has no interest in marriage. Parvati washes his feet, wipes his brow, and lays sixteen offerings before him, but he won\u2019t even look at her. Sage Narada advises her to invoke Shiva\u2019s name--Om Namah Shivaya--over and over again as a mantra. So in the heat of the sun, in the driving rain, in snow up to her neck Parvati sits and repeats her beloved\u2019s name until the focused power of her intent opens his heart and persuades him to ask for her hand in marriage.  Parvati\u2019s timeless story teaches children that with enough love and perseverance even the seemingly impossible can be achieved.

The aim was to frighten Britain into concessions and, if that failed, to bring the war to a swift conclusion with a quick strike at Canada. But the British refused to cave in to American demands, the Canadian campaign ended in disaster, and the U.S. government had to flee Washington, D.C., when it was invaded and burned by a British army.By all objective measures, the War of 1812 was a debacle for the young republic, and yet it was celebrated as a great military triumph. The American people believed they had won the war and expelled the invader. Oliver H. Perry became a military hero, Francis Scott Key composed what became the national anthem and commenced a national reverence for the flag, and the U.S.S. Constitution, Old Ironsides, became a symbol of American invincibility. Every aspect of the war, from its causes to its conclusion, was refashioned to heighten the successes, obscure the mistakes, and blur embarrassing distinctions, long before there were mass media or public relations officers in the Pentagon.In this entertaining and meticulously researched book by America's leading authority on the War of 1812, Donald R. Hickey dispels the many misconcep-tions that distort our view of America's second war with Great Britain. Embracing military, naval, political, economic, and diplomatic analyses, Hickey looks carefully at how the war was fought between 1812 and 1815, and how it was remembered thereafter. Was the original declaration of war a bluff? What were the real roles of Canadian traitor Joseph Willcocks, Mohawk leader John Norton, pirate Jean Laffite, and American naval hero Lucy Baker? Who killed the Shawnee chief Tecumseh and who shot the British general Isaac Brock? Who actually won the war, and what is its lasting legacy? Hickey peels away fantasies and embellishments to explore why cer-tain myths gained currency and how they contributed to the way that the United States and Canada view themselves and each other.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "North American Hi...", "American History"], "author": "Donald R.

The facts of Joan of Arc's life are straightforward: she was born in 1412, in Domremy, France, to a peasant family; she participated in the Hundred Years' War but was in active military service for only a year; and she was burned at the stake at 19. Novelist Gordon, who has always been fascinated by the young heroine, emphasizes Joan the girl. She acknowledges that the 17-year-old could have been a wife and mother, a fully adult member of her community. But Gordon's Joan has a young girl's heedlessness, sureness, readiness for utter self-surrender. This biography rehearses the well-known highlights in Joan's short life: the voices she heard who charged her with the mission to save France; her participation in the Battle of Orleans and the coronation of King Charles VII; her trial by an ecclesiastical court, where she was charged with witchcraft, heresy and idolatry. The judges, Gordon tells us in a deft and clever interpretation, connected Joan's cross-dressing to the sin of idolatry. (They) were accusing Joan of making an idol of herself. Gordon recounts Joan's excommunication and execution in spare and arresting detail. The strength of this biographical meditation lies in the penultimate chapter, in which Gordon investigates the numerous re-creations of Joan on stage and screen, from Carl Dreyer's 1928 film The Passion of Joan of Arc to Verdi's opera Giovanna d'Arco -- a chapter that comes like an unexpected dessert at the end of a rich feast.", "genre": ["History", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "France", "Religion", "Historical", "Biography Memoir"], "author": "Mary Gordon", "rating": "3.47", "pages": "208"}, {"id": 1204728, "title": "Il Principe.

The translator has shown great discernment in his choice of words and in their placement. This makes for a smooth reading.

More than any other Confederate state, Georgia mixed economic modernization with a large and concentrated slave population.

A constellation of state-owned factories in Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, and Macon made up a sizeable munitions and supply complex that kept Confederate armies in the fields for four years against the preeminent industrial power of the North. Moreover, the government in Richmond provided numerous official goads and incentives to non-government manufacturers, setting off a boom in private industry.

When we meet Alex again, he is a grown man, an autograph dealer and devoted slacker, suffering the physical and spiritual after-effects of a three-day romance with a drug called Superstar. While under its malign influence, Alex has managed to wreck his sports car, alienate his girlfriend Esther, and--possibly--forge the rare autograph of his idol, the 1950s movie star Kitty Alexander.Will his friends save him from the embarrassment of trying to sell this suspect autograph? Will they pull him together in time to perform Kaddish on the 15th anniversary of his father's death?

Let\u2019s all pray for Amanda, says one earnest classmate. Surely God will make her well if He hears our prayers. Mrs. Green is confronted with the dilemma that every public school teacher must be ready to deal with. While the church-state separation laws won\u2019t allow school prayer, Mrs. Green wants to do something to help her students cope with a life-threatening situation that has raised deep questions.Thus begins a conversation between teacher and students that forms the basis of this thoughtful work. Starting with the historic concept of separation of church and state, the curious youngsters\u2019 insistent questions lead to a consideration of philosophic issues: Why shouldn\u2019t they pray for Amanda in class? Why do some people believe in God while others don\u2019t? Is there life after death? What gives life meaning? In the course of what becomes a parent-approved after-school discussion, Mrs. Green presents a humanistic point of view, making the following points. Humanists look at life as a natural process, so they don\u2019t believe in the supernatural. They rely on science to explain the meaning of life, not on religion, though they support each person\u2019s freedom to choose to believe or not to believe. Rather than speculating about what comes after death, humanists prefer to focus on life on earth. Humanists generally espouse the values of universal education, freedom of thought and free expression, open-minded pursuit of the truth, tolerance of others\u2019 differences, mutual respect, and preservation of the environment.Complete with discussion questions, suggestions for activities, and a bibliography, this innovative approach to presenting humanism to young adults will be welcome by parents and teachers looking to expose their children or students to a secular philosophic perspective.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Religion", "Philosophy", "Parenting", "Childrens"], "author": "Helen Bennett", "rating": "3.75", "pages": "77"}, {"id": 1208045, "title": "Arabic Geometrical Pattern and Design", "blurb": "By forbidding the representation of the human figure, the Mohammedan religion helped push Islamic art along a path much different from that of traditional European art. European abounds with perspective renderings of figures and landscapes, while Islamic translates artistic impulse into elaborate geometric patterns and linear designs. Through centuries of practicing this purely abstract art, Muslim artists have perfected it to an incomparable elegance.This book contains 190 examples exhibiting the wide range of Islamic geometrical art: hexagon designs, octagon designs, dodecagon designs, combinations of stars and rosettes (of many variations), combinations of squares and octagons, heptagon designs, and pentagon designs. These fundamental shapes give rise to hundreds of different designs, and merely altering an angle or curving a straight line can create an entirely new pattern. When transferred to metal, wood, stucco, mosaic, and paint, these patterns make up the elaborate ornamentation for which Arabic architecture is noted, and twenty-eight examples of actual applications from Cairo and Damascus are included: sanctuary doors, openwork windows, inlaid marble pavements, and ceilings. The reader may wish to try his own hand at drawing patterns, to which purpose dotted construction lines are given for sections of the plates.

In a series of essays that cohere into a spiritual autobiography, the author writes prose that's deceptively simple yet rich in metaphor. An wild horse living in the parking lot of a Navajo school becomes a symbol for living creatures' intrinsic wildness, tamed only at a terrible cost. We are all runaway horses is one constant refrain, as is the reminder you are your history. The author's history is painful: born in 1950 the son of an alcoholic Native American woman and a white cowboy father who would sell my mom to other migrant men for five dollars, Nasdijj grew up a mongrel and an outcast, contending with his violent father's demons while his mother beguiled them with Indian stories. Living on a reservation, never fully accepted because of his white skin, he adopted a baby boy with fetal alcohol syndrome who died at age 6. The book's most beautiful passages meditate on Tommy Nothing Fancy's short life and express his father's love. Nasdijj has been homeless, he has taught Indian children on a reservation, he has retraced with a historian friend the dreadful forced march to Bosque Redondo, where the Navajo and their culture were nearly exterminated. These and many other ordeals are related in the agonizingly lucid words of someone who has turned to writing as a lifeline. This remarkable memoir has its share of bitterness and anger, but Nasdijj transcends both in his acceptance of the world that made him and in the knowledge that the reservation runs like blood through a river of my dreams. --Wendy Smith", "genre": ["Fiction", "Native Americans"], "author": "Nasdijj", "rating": "3.76", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 1208687, "title": "The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand: Truth and Toleration in Objectivism", "blurb": "Ayn Rand's philosophical novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged made her the most controversial author of her age.

Her works have drawn millions of readers and continue to sell at a breathtaking pace. Their impact on American culture runs from libertarian politics to the self-esteem movement in psychology to the rugged individualism of Silicon Valley and the Internet. Rand also launched a movement of intellectuals committed to her philosophy of Objectivism. While it has grown dramatically since Rand's death in 1982, however, the Objectivist movement has also fractured into rival camps whose differences over doctrine and strategy are compounded by competition for leadership and bitter accusations of heresy.In Truth and Toleration, philosopher David Kelley analyzes the conflicts that led him to break ranks with orthodox Objectivists and create an independent branch of the movement. Originally published in 1990 as a manifesto, this work has been revised as an analysis of the principles of intellectual collaboration-the terms on which intellectuals and activists can work together in a common cause. Going beyond the immediate issues, Kelley discusses the nature of individual responsibility for the spread of ideas and for their historical consequences. He offers a new argument for toleration based on a non-relativistic theory of truth. He describes the nature of tribalism among intellectuals, showing how the troubled legacy of Ayn Rand has followed a pattern similar to the not-so-civil wars among followers of other original and charismatic thinkers such as Marx and Freud. In a postscript for the second edition, Kelley reviews the growth in Objectivist scholarship and the influence of Rand's ideas over the past decade.Truth and Toleration is an engaging introduction to the Objectivist movement, its core ideas, and its central fissures. At the same time, it offers a case study in the sociology of intellectual movements and a frank discussion of the issues that arise whenever thinkers leave their studies to promote their idea in the public realm.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "David Kelley", "rating": "4.35", "pages": "128"}, {"id": 1208701, "title": "Tower of Dreams", "blurb": "Blaine Ramsey is an image-digger.

He draws from a multitude of primary sources, including personal correspondence and political memoranda, to show how Britain, at the height of her power but suffering from internal political strife, made one mistake after another, culminating in the loss of her prized colonies. In opposition to King George's American policies were such towering figures as William Pitt, Edmund Burke, and Charles James Fox; their speeches in the House of Commons are some of the best oratory in the English language. But despite their eloquence and forcefulness, they did not have the votes to prevail. In the end, the Americans rebelled as much against an English political state of mind as against the British Army. Cook takes us through the war years: King George's decision that blows must decide the colonies' future; Lord North's futile effort to negotiate peace after the British defeat at Saratoga, which only hastened the American alliance with France; the secret letter from Washington to Lafayette that the British intercepted, perhaps altering the outcome of the Battle of Yorktown; and the peace negotiations masterminded by Franklin and John Jay. Winner of the Colonial Dames of America Annual Book Award 1996. The Long Fuse is a marvelous new way of understanding the Revolutionary War.

In this book, Rush Rehm considers how and why the conflation of the two ceremonies comes to theatrical life in the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes.

Yet this strife-tornland is also the birthplace of the world's favorite wine: champagne.In this engrossing history, Don and Petie Kladstrup show how this sparkling wine, born of bloodshed, became a symbol of glamour, good times, and celebration. It's a story filled with larger-than-life characters:Dom P\u00e9rignon, the father of champagne, who, contrary to popular belief, worked his entire life to keep bubbles out of champagne; the Sun King, Louis XIV, who rarely drank anything but; and Napoleon, who, in trying to conquer the world, introduced it to champagne.Then there were the generations of local vintners who struggled to keep their houses running. Claude Mo\u00ebt hauled his bottles to Versailles and gave Madame de Pompadour her first taste of bubbly, prompting her memorable quote, Champagne is the only wine that lets a woman remain beautiful after she has drunk it. There was also Charles-Camille Heidsieck, known as Champagne Charlie, who popularized champagne in America and ended up being imprisoned as a spy during the Civil War.World War I would be Champagne's greatest test of all, a four-year nightmare in which nearly everything the Champenois had worked and fought for was destroyed in a rain of iron and fire. German bombardment drove thousands of people underground to seek refuge in the huge cellars of the champagne houses, where among the bottles you would find schools, hospitals, shops, municipal offices, and troops.Amazingly, grapes continued to be harvested even as bombs fell, and the wartime vintages are considered to be among the finest ever made.An unforgettable history, Champagne will forever change how you look at a glass of bubbly.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Alcohol", "Wine", "Nonfiction", "Food and Drink", "Food", "History", "Microhistory", "Cultural", "France", "History", "Food History", "Food and Drink", "Food and Drink", "Food and Wine", "Politics"], "author": "Don Kladstrup", "rating": "3.98", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 1210179, "title": "Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In", "blurb": "Describes a method of negotiation that isolates problems, focuses on interests, creates new options, and uses objective criteria to help two parties reach an agreement Amazon.com description: Product Description: Since its original publication nearly thirty years ago, Getting to Yes has helped millions of people learn a better way to negotiate.

Cumont discusses the Romans' attitudes about the importance of the tomb, the distinctions they made between a shade and a soul, the rules of admittance to Hades and the Elysian Fields, the supernatural journeys of the dead, the ancient roots of the Romans' beliefs and practices, and much more. With solid research behind him, Cumont's reassuring erudition righted inaccuracies about Roman religion that had lingered, particularly in the writings of Christian apologists, and this continues to be a fundamental work of Roman paganism today. Belgian archaeologist and historian FRANZ-VALERY-MARIE CUMONT (1869-1947) wrote numerous books, among them Texts and Illustrated Monuments Relating to the Mysteries of Mithra (1900), considered his masterwork.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "History", "Religion", "Paganism"], "author": "Franz Cumont", "rating": "3.92", "pages": "244"}, {"id": 1211429, "title": "Murphy's Law #3", "blurb": "Includes quotable quotes to be used for speeches, toasts, or roasts for anyone who has experienced the inescapable moment when everything goes wrong", "genre": ["Humor"], "author": "Arthur Bloch", "rating": "3.49", "pages": "93"}, {"id": 1211475, "title": "The Weak Body of a Useless Woman: Matsuo Taseko and the Meiji Restoration", "blurb": "In 1862, fifty-one-year-old Matsuo Taseko left her old life behind by traveling to Kyoto, the old imperial capital.

Although she played a minor role in the events that led to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, her actions were nonetheless astonishing for a woman of her day. Honored as a hero even before her death, Taseko has since been adopted as a patron saint by rightist nationalists.In telling Taseko's story, Anne Walthall gives us not just the first full biography in English of a peasant woman of the Tokugawa period (1603-1868), but also fresh perspectives on the practices and intellectual concerns of rural entrepreneurs and their role in the Meiji Restoration. Writing about Taseko with a depth and complexity that has thus far been accorded only to men of that time, Walthall has uncovered a tale that will captivate anyone concerned with women's lives and with Japan's dramatic transition to modernity.", "genre": ["Japan", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "History", "Japanese History"], "author": "Anne Walthall", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "428"}, {"id": 1211526, "title": "Revolutionary Premiere 6", "blurb": "Film-making is no longer the preserve of the rich and famous.

Yet less than two years later, he issued a proclamation intended to free all slaves throughout the Confederate states. When critics challenged the constitutional soundness of the act, Lincoln pointed to the international laws and usages of war as the legal basis for his Proclamation, asserting that the Constitution invested the president with the law of war in time of war. As the Civil War intensified, the Lincoln administration slowly and reluctantly accorded full belligerent rights to the Confederacy under the law of war. This included designating a prisoner of war status for captives, honoring flags of truce, and negotiating formal agreements for the exchange of prisoners -- practices that laid the intellectual foundations for emancipation. Once the United States allowed Confederates all the privileges of belligerents under international law, it followed that they should also suffer the disadvantages, including trial by military courts, seizure of property, and eventually the emancipation of slaves. Even after the Lincoln administration decided to apply the law of war, it was unclear whether state and federal courts would agree. After careful analysis, author Burrus M. Carnahan concludes that if the courts had decided that the proclamation was not justified, the result would have been the personal legal liability of thousands of Union officers to aggrieved slave owners. This argument offers further support to the notion that Lincoln's delay in issuing the Emancipation Proclamation was an exercise of political prudence, not a personal reluctance to free the slaves. In Act of Justice, Carnahan contends that Lincoln was no reluctant emancipator; he wrote a truly radical document that treated Confederate slaves as an oppressed people rather than merely as enemy property. In this respect, Lincoln's proclamation anticipated the psychological warfare tactics of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Carnahan's exploration of the president's war powers illuminates the origins of early debates about war powers and the Constitution and their link to international law.", "genre": ["Law", "History", "Civil War", "American History"], "author": "Burrus M.

Luke is hesitant to train fighters from another country in the skills he learned at TOPGUN, but he won't be allowed to start the school without agreeing. The school opens, but the closer he gets to these students, the more he suspects that they may have an entirely different, and malicious, agenda in mind. They have a bone to pick with the United States and may be using Luke's school as their Trojan Horse to get into the country and launch an attack that would cause more damage than that sustained at Pearl Harbor. It falls to Luke to discover their plan and to stop it before it spirals out of control.With Fallout James W. Huston scores big with his most riveting and thought-provoking thriller yet.

Decrying the South\u2019s economic backwardness and political conservatism, the Roosevelt Administration launched a series of programs to reorder the Southern economy in the 1930s. After 1950, however, the social welfare state had been replaced by the national security state as the South\u2019s principal benefactor. Bruce J. Schulman contrasts the diminished role of national welfare initiatives in the postwar South with the expansion of military and defense-related programs. He analyzes the contributions of these growth-oriented programs to the South\u2019s remarkable economic expansion, to the development of American liberalism, and to the excruciating limits of Sunbelt prosperity, ultimately relating these developments to southern politics and race relations. By linking the history of the South with the history of national public policy, Schulman unites two issues that dominate the domestic history of postwar America\u2014the emergence of the Sunbelt and the expansion of federal power over the nation\u2019s economic and social life.

Suffused with Addams's abiding compassion, tempered with her pragmatism and humor, and shot through with anecdotes of her own experiences with young people, The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets is a level-headed assessment of the challenges facing urban youth and the most effective ways to meet them. When this book was first published in 1909, Addams was the most famous woman in America. A celebrity and a spiritual leader, she was widely regarded as practical, realistic, and endowed with a special insight into the problems of urban America. The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets--her favorite of her own books--establishes Addams as an accomplished writer as well as a reformer. In this compact volume she examines the causes for the discontent of youth in the city, chiding educators for their persistent blindness to youth's most obvious needs. Addams argues for the importance of providing direction and focus--for example, through public recreation, practical education, and experiences in the arts--for the pent-up energies of young men and women. She takes a realistic view of their basic social and sexual drives and their disaffection and alienation in an industrial world. At the same time, she rejects the hereditary explanations for delinquency that prevailed in her day. Allen F. Davis's introduction provides a biographical profile of Addams and a commentary on her importance as a writer and a social activist. \u00a0\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Cities", "Urban Planning"], "author": "Jane Addams", "rating": "3.67", "pages": "192"}, {"id": 1217240, "title": "Fudgeballs And Other Sweets", "blurb": "Fudgeballs And Other Sweets by Lori Copeland released on Feb 20, 1998 is available now for purchase.", "genre": ["Romance", "Contemporary Romance"], "author": "Lori Copeland", "rating": "3.38", "pages": "Paperback"}, {"id": 1217325, "title": "The Quotable Writer", "blurb": "The Quotable Writer taps the power of words for the wordsmiths who live and make their living by them.

The account, written by the German historian Karl-Heinz Frieser and edited by American historian John T. Greenwood, provides the definitive explanation for Germany's startling success and the equally surprising military collapse of France and Britain on the European continent in 1940. In a little over a month, Germany defeated the Allies in battle, a task that had not been achieved in four years of brutal fighting during World War I.First published in 1995 as the official German history of the 1940 campaign, this book goes beyond standard explanations to show that the German victory was not inevitable and that French defeat was not preordained. Contrary to most accounts of the campaign, Frieser's illustrates that the military systems of both Germany and France were solid and that their campaign plans were sound. The key to victory or defeat, Frieser argues, was the execution of operational plans--both preplanned and ad hoc--amid the eternal Clausewitzian combat factors of friction and the fog of war. He shows why, on the eve of the campaign, the British and French leaders had good cause to be confident and why many German generals were understandably concerned that disaster was looming for them.This study explodes many of the myths concerning German blitzkrieg warfare and the planning for the 1940 campaign. Frieser's groundbreaking interpretation of the topic has been the subject of discussion since the German edition first appeared.

Tom Segev's acclaimed works One Palestine, Complete and The Seventh Million overturned accepted views of the history of Israel. Now, in 1967\u2014a number-one bestseller in Israel\u2014he brings his masterful skills to the watershed year when six days of war reshaped the country and the entire region. Going far beyond a military account, Segev re-creates the crisis in Israel before 1967, showing how economic recession, a full grasp of the Holocaust's horrors, and the dire threats made by neighbor states combined to produce a climate of apocalypse. He depicts the country's bravado after its victory, the mood revealed in a popular joke in which one soldier says to his friend, Let's take over Cairo; the friend replies, Then what shall we do in the afternoon? Drawing on unpublished letters and diaries, as well as government memos and military records, Segev reconstructs an era of new possibilities and tragic missteps. He introduces the legendary figures\u2014Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir, Gamal Abdul Nasser, and Lyndon Johnson\u2014and an epic cast of soldiers, lobbyists, refugees, and settlers. He reveals as never before Israel's intimacy with the White House as well as the political rivalries that sabotaged any chance of peace. Above all, he challenges the view that the war was inevitable, showing that a series of disastrous miscalculations lie behind the bloodshed. A vibrant and original history, 1967 is sure to stand as the definitive account of that pivotal year.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Cultural", "Israel", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "War", "War", "Military Fiction", "Literature", "Jewish", "Earth", "The World", "Military", "Military History", "Historical"], "author": "Tom Segev", "rating": "3.95", "pages": "0"}, {"id": 1218530, "title": "Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge: The Book of Mnemonic Devices", "blurb": "When is a tulip* not a flower?

From this starting point, Anne Carson launches an exploration, poetic in its own right, of the idea of poetic economy. She offers a reading of certain of Simonides' texts and aligns these with writings of the modern Romanian poet Paul Celan, a Jew and survivor of the Holocaust, whose economies of language are notorious. Asking such questions as, What is lost when words are wasted? and Who profits when words are saved? Carson reveals the two poets' striking commonalities.In Carson's view Simonides and Celan share a similar mentality or disposition toward the world, language and the work of the poet. Economy of the Unlost begins by showing how each of the two poets stands in a state of alienation between two worlds. In Simonides' case, the gift economy of fifth-century b.c. Greece was giving way to one based on money and commodities, while Celan's life spanned pre- and post-Holocaust worlds, and he himself, writing in German, became estranged from his native language. Carson goes on to consider various aspects of the two poets' techniques for coming to grips with the invisible through the visible world. A focus on the genre of the epitaph grants insights into the kinds of exchange the poets envision between the living and the dead. Assessing the impact on Simonidean composition of the material fact of inscription on stone, Carson suggests that a need for brevity influenced the exactitude and clarity of Simonides' style, and proposes a comparison with Celan's interest in the negative design of printmaking: both poets, though in different ways, employ a kind of negative image making, cutting away all that is superfluous. This book's juxtaposition of the two poets illuminates their differences--Simonides' fundamental faith in the power of the word, Celan's ultimate despair--as well as their similarities; it provides fertile ground for the virtuosic interplay of Carson's scholarship and her poetic sensibility.", "genre": ["Poetry", "Essays", "Nonfiction", "Criticism", "Philosophy", "History", "Literary Criticism"], "author": "Anne Carson", "rating": "4.28", "pages": "147"}, {"id": 1220005, "title": "The Unburied", "blurb": "The Basic Series brings blockbuster bestsellers and new releases from bestselling authors to Large Print readers as close as possible to the regular print publication date.

In Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire, he places himself at the center of the debate on psychoanalytic theory, challenging the state of Freudian theory and modern-day psychoanalytic practice and questioning the premises on which psychoanalysis is based. In so doing, Eysenck illustrates the shortcomings of both psychoanalysis as a method of curing neurotic and psychotic behaviors, and of the theory of dreams and their interpretation. He also analyzes Freud's influence on anthropology and his alleged contributions to science. While books about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis abound, most have been written by followers and acolytes and are therefore uncritical, unaware of alternative theories, or written as weapons in a war of propaganda. Others are long and highly technical, and therefore valuable only to students and professionals.

In exploring the political and cultural dynamics that have shaped racial representations in Puerto Rico\u2019s commercial media from the late 1940s to the 1990s, Yeidy M. Rivero advances critical discussions about race, ethnicity, and the media. She shows that televisual representations of race have belied the racial egalitarianism that allegedly pervades Puerto Rico\u2019s national culture. White performers in blackface have often portrayed \u201cblackness\u201d in local television productions, while black actors have been largely excluded.Drawing on interviews, participant observation, archival research, and textual analysis, Rivero considers representations of race in Puerto Rico, taking into account how they are intertwined with the island\u2019s status as a U.S. commonwealth, its national culture, its relationship with Cuba before the Cuban Revolution in 1959, and the massive influx of Cuban migrants after 1960. She focuses on locally produced radio and television shows, particular television events, and characters that became popular media icons\u2014from the performer Ram\u00f3n Rivero\u2019s use of blackface and \u201cblack\u201d voice in the 1940s and 1950s, to the battle between black actors and television industry officials over racism in the 1970s, to the creation, in the 1990s, of the first Puerto Rican situation comedy featuring a black family. As the twentieth century drew to a close, multinational corporations had purchased all Puerto Rican stations and threatened to wipe out locally produced programs. Tuning Out Blackness brings to the forefront the marginalization of nonwhite citizens in Puerto Rico\u2019s media culture and raises important questions about the significance of local sites of television production.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Yeidy M.

The passenger-narrator, manhandling my overcoat, slides into the car and orders him to go to the St. Moritz Hotel.

A student and admirer of the classic Hollywood cinema, Allen combines this appreciation for American directors with a developed sensitivity to experimental European directors such as Fellini, De Sica and Bergman. Probably the most widely recognized aspect of his work involves his films that experiment with narrative, plot and psychology. In the films dating from the early seventies, Allen develops into one of America's great innovative directors as he takes his brilliant comic impulses seriously. His technical, literary, visual and linguistic innovations introduce intensity and complexity to his humour.

New York Times Book Review This book deserves to be widely read. Library Journal Nothing like the regime of Huey Long has ever been enacted on American soil before. Only a patriot of the staunchest character could stand up to the power of Huey and the threats and reprisals which he used so freely. Those who were willing to do so paralleled the acts of America's bravest patriots at any stage of American history. Nearly all the books on this subject end with the death of Huey Long. Louisiana Hayride continues through the years of scandals which ended in my election in 1940. Huey's prediction that his successors would never be able to wield his great power without going to jail was born out by events described in this book. This is the story of the sowing of the wind, but the major part of the book is devoted to the reaping of the whirlwind. In this telling, Louisiana Hayride is unsurpassed.

Kerr had great fun writing his novel, The Akhenaten Adventure. The way the author introduces his cleverly named characters, the atmospheric setting, the fun tone of his narration--all indicate that a hugely entertaining story is in store. The first installment of his Children of the Lamp sequence is set firmly in the present day, but it soon breaks away and encompasses several wonderfully colorful parts of the globe, England and Egypt included.  John and Philippa Gaunt, two twelve-year-old not-very-identical twins, live a privileged life on the Upper East of Manhattan with their wealthy parents and two curiously-mannered Rottweilers named Alan and Neil. The twins realize there's something amiss with their world when a string of strange things begin to happen after their wisdom teeth are extracted--they dream the same dreams, become stronger, their zits clear up, and wishes wished in their presence inexplicably come true. And, when their estranged Uncle Nimrod asks them to come to England for the summer during one such shared dream, the discovery of their destiny is set in motion.   John and Phillippa discover that they are descended from a long line of Djinn, have great inherent powers. They must call on these powers a lot sooner than they anticipated, though, because the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten is not as dead as history has so far declared and his legion of seventy magical djinn could tip the balance of power in the magical realm and affect the whole world order.   P.B. Kerr, under his given name Philip Kerr, is the author of several bestselling thrillers for adult readers.

No previously published work on the archaeology of mortuary remains presents such a range of examples of ritual practices through time and around the globe. \u00a0 Because of its wide scope and interdisciplinary approach, Interacting with the Dead will be indispensable not only to archaeologists and anthropologists but also across the social sciences and humanities and to all who study cross-cultural rituals.", "genre": ["Archaeology", "Anthropology"], "author": "Gordon F.

Her first books with journalist Lindsay Gordon as heroine gave hints of the talent that was to mature so impressively--and the subsequent series with the resourceful private eye Kate Brannigan demonstrated a sharper eye for the harder edges of society. But the best was just around the corner. McDermid's third sequence with clinical psychologist profiler Tony Hill was something of a quantum leap: as well as forging one of the most memorable figures in contemporary crime fiction with mildly eccentric Hill, McDermid added a degree of psychological acuity that made the earlier books seem like warm-ups for the main event.The latest outing for Hill, The Torment of Others, also features McDermid's other richly realised creation, DCI Carol Jordan, and the author carries her familiar protagonists into truly unsettling new areas. This time, Hill is coping with a return to practical clinical profiling after a frustrating spell as an academic. And there's another major complication for him: his ex-partner Carol Jordan is no longer sure she wishes to be in charge of a team after the brutal sexual assault she suffered during undercover work. But she is persuaded to do so--and realises that one of her main tasks will be to create a cohesive unit.A dead woman discovered in a sexual position on a bloody mattress, appears to be the victim of a killer the team knows all about: the monstrous Derek Tyler, who had carried out similarly bloody work two years before. However, forensics have landed Tyler in a mental institution--does this mean that Hill and Jordan are searching for a murderer who is copying the techniques of the psychotic Tyler?While this may not be the best starting point for those new to McDermid, enthusiasts will find all the key elements are firmly and satisfyingly in place. --Barry Forshaw", "genre": ["Mystery", "Crime", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Mystery Thriller", "Suspense", "British Literature"], "author": "Val McDermid", "rating": "4.17", "pages": "Hardcover"}, {"id": 1225915, "title": "Recapturing Spirit of Enterprise", "blurb": "The wellspring of capital will not be found on Wall Street or in the stuffy halls of corporate America, but instead in the hopes and dreams of people who want to create new products and new approaches to problem solving.

It embrioled peoples from opposite sides of the globe; it was fought in China, across the expanses of the Pacific, and in the jungles of Southeast Asia; and it was devastating in its consequences for civilians andservicemen alike. It saw the first use of atomic weapons, hastened the end of the Western empires in Asia, and marked America's rise to the position of the most powerful nation in the world. Christopher Thorne, whose previous studies of the war in the Pacific have become landmarks in the field, here weaves together both the entire network of international relations surrounding the war and the impact the war had on all the societies involved--Indian as well as American; Australianand New Zealand as well as Japanese; Korean, Chinese, and Southeast Asian as well as British, French, and Dutch. The Issue of War draws on material gathered over many years in the Far East, Western Europe, and the U.S.--material including wartime films, broadcasts, and newspapers,as well ascountless private and offical papers. Representing a synthesis of military, diplomatic, economic, intellectual, and social history, it not only places the war in the context of developments before 1941, but illuminates various patterns that cut across the familiar distinctions between Asia and theWest or between Japan and the Allies.

And like the poor young maiden, once a producer gets hold of a script, spreads its pages, and tosses it aside, it's never as valuable again.\nSpeaking from experience is bruised, inveterate screenwriter Frankie Jordan, who spares nothing and no one in her razor-sharp vivisection of Hollywood -- a town with rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices as strange as any savage culture. Not that the rest of Frankie's life is any less perilous. She's turning forty, her husband wants a divorce, men aren't noticing her anymore, and all she can think about is the script she can't finish.Along comes Jonathan Prince, a confident, Ivy League twenty-four-year-old agent trainee in butter-soft loafers who glides into Frankie's messy life. In a town that takes glee in the failure of others, Jonathan becomes her biggest fan, the only one who seems to recognize her brilliance.The lunacy of trying to sell her script is described in harrowing detail and perfect-pitch dialogue.

After I put down the book, I was inspired to pick up my paddle.--Brad Manley, Paddle Florida!Johnny Molloy, author of several best-selling outdoor guides to Florida, is always game for adventure. In his latest, he travels the Sunshine State from north to south along some of its most famous rivers, swamps, salt marshes, and open waters in search of Florida's disappearing history.This personal travelogue of his two-month expedition begins in a canoe at the Okefenokee Swamp, headwaters of Florida's best-known river. Paddling the dark Suwannee, Molloy curves through the scenic and sometimes wild Big Shoals, past sparkling clear springs--Troy and Turtle and Rock Bluff and more--to the Gulf of Mexico, where he transfers his grub, life jacket, and portable computer into a sea kayak. He continues past Tampa Bay into the Everglades and then heads due south, ending his voyage at Long Key and the Atlantic Ocean.Molloy focuses here on the state's history, human and natural, and on the interplay between the land and the water around it. He describes attempts made through the centuries to explore them, conquer them, and, finally, to coexist with and preserve them. He also invites readers to eavesdrop on his conversations with characters along the way, from anglers on the Suwannee River to crabbers off the shore of Everglades City.Best of all, Molloy invites readers to join him on this remarkable excursion -- either from their armchairs, following his references to bridges, highways, and towns along the route and charting his journey on the maps provided, or by taking to the water themselves--to soak up the sunshine and soft Florida air, to listen to the evening frogs and crickets, and to ponder the mystery of what has been lost in Florida and what might yet be saved.Johnny Molloy is the author of 17 books.\n...more", "genre": ["Travel"], "author": "Johnny Molloy", "rating": "3.86", "pages": "240"}, {"id": 1227328, "title": "Diego", "blurb": "Illus. in full color.

But in this hard-hitting new book, author Robert J. Hutchinson argues that it is actually much more than this. The ideas enshrined in the Bible, he says, triggered a revolution in human thought and established the moral and philosophical foundation for Western civilization, from the recognition of basic human rights and belief in limited government to authentic feminism and the development of empirical science. He shows that it is more a culture-war book than a work of religious apologetics. Though the Bible is today under relentless attack by left-wing academics, novelists, and screenwriters to justify their own political agendas, Hutchinson fires back in this fast-paced, politically incorrect tour of the most important book ever written. This is a book atheists will fear and honest inquirers and believers will relish.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Nonfiction", "History", "Religion", "Christianity", "Christian", "Politics", "Philosophy", "Religion", "Theology", "Christian", "Christian Living", "Audiobook"], "author": "Robert J.

It's now possible to use Internet tools to organize a rally, energize a political campaign, arrange a date, join a support group, or sell a product, as naturally as we use a phone.Through a series of pertinent case studies and interviews with leading thinkers and doers in this rapidly evolving field, Christian Crumlish uncovers universal themes and lessons learned. He illustrates how we use peer-to-peer technologies--web services, blogs, mobile phone SMS, and more--to accomplish widespread goals. He also suggests how we can take even more advantage of these technologies to connect with people who have similar interests.Discover how Howard Dean's campaign used the Internet to take a little-known candidate a long way. How activists arrange public meetings and drive letter-writing campaigns. How individuals find much-needed help for personal issues. How artists promote and air their creative genius. How business people and singles seek potential partners. And much, much more.

Drawing on a wide range of new evidence--including personal letters and archaeological evidence derived from the recent discovery of Bering's grave site--the author reconstructs Bering's personality, his perilous voyages, and his uneasy relationship with the naturalist Georg Steller, who unobtrusively guided the stranded expedition as Bering lay dying.A riveting narrative of adventure and disaster on the high seas, this biography is also a major contribution to the history of maritime exploration.A biography of Bering has long been needed and no one is better suited to write it than Orcutt Frost. Based on meticulous scholarship and a lifelong knowledge of the subject, this biography will be a revelation to anyone interested in the history of exploration. --Glyn Williams, author of Voyages of Delusion: The Quest for the Northwest PassageOrcutt Frost, emeritus professor of the humanities at Alaska Pacific University, is an authority on Bering's voyages and has written numerous books and articles on the subject.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Russia", "Biography"], "author": "O.W.

Setterfield has rejuvenated the genre with this closely plotted, clever foray into a world of secrets, confused identities, lies, and half-truths. She never cheats by pulling a rabbit out of a hat; this atmospheric story hangs together perfectly.  There are two heroines here: Vida Winter, a famous author, whose life story is coming to an end, and Margaret Lea, a young, unworldly, bookish girl who is a bookseller in her father's shop. Vida has been confounding her biographers and fans for years by giving everybody a different version of her life, each time swearing it's the truth. Because of a biography that Margaret has written about brothers, Vida chooses Margaret to tell her story, all of it, for the first time. At their initial meeting, the conversation begins:   You have given nineteen different versions of your life story to journalists in the last two years alone. She [Vida] shrugged. It's my profession. I'm a storyteller. I am a biographer, I work with facts.  The game is afoot and Margaret must spend some time sorting out whether or not Vida is actually ready to tell the whole truth. There is more here of Margaret discovering than of Vida cooperating wholeheartedly, but that is part of Vida's plan.  Margaret has a story of her own: she was one of conjoined twins and her sister died so that Margaret could live. She feels an otherworldly aura sometimes or a yearning for a part of her that is forever missing. Vida's story involves two wild girls--feral twins (is she one of them?)--who would have been better off being suckled by wolves. Instead, their mother and uncle, involved in things too unsavory to contemplate, combine to neglect them woefully. There's also a governess, a Doctor, a kindly housekeeper, a gardener, and another presence--a very strange presence--which Margaret perceives as a ghost at first. Making obeisance to other great ghost stories, there is a deadly fire, a beautiful old house gone to ruin, and always that presence....  The transformative power of truth informs the lives of both women by story's end, and The Thirteenth Tale is finally and convincingly told. --Valerie RyanAbridged: 6 CDs, 7 hours running time.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Gothic", "Writing", "Books About Books", "Adult", "Fantasy", "Historical", "Thriller", "Mystery Thriller", "Book Club"], "author": "Diane Setterfield", "rating": "3.97", "pages": "7"}, {"id": 1230962, "title": "A Geometrical Picture Book", "blurb": "How do you convey to students, colleagues and friends some of the beauty of the kind of mathematics you are interested in?

Foucaults Analyse der modernen Gouvernementmentalit\u00e4t darf gerade heute Aktualit\u00e4t beanspruchen.

Damit kann er die Beziehungen zwischen Bio-Politik und Rassismus, Freiheit und Sicherheit, dem Abbau sozialstaatlicher Leistungen und dem zunehmenden Appell an Eigenverantwortung und Selbstsorge aufzeigen.Der Neoliberalismus ist demnach eine Rationalit\u00e4t, die nicht nur eine neue Form des Sozialen erfindet, sondern auch eine neue Subjektivit\u00e4t.

Fueled by an explosive mix of makeup, costumes, and attitude, KISS burst onto the music scene thirty years ago and has become a rock institution. The band has sold more than eighty million records, has broken every concert attendance record set by Elvis Presley and the Beatles, stands behind the Beatles alone in number of gold records from any group in history, and has spawned more than 2,500 licenses. There would have been no KISS without Gene Simmons, the outrageous star whose superlong tongue, legendary sexual exploits, and demonic makeup have made him a rock icon. KISS and Make-Up is the wild, shocking, unbelievable story, from the man himself, about how an immigrant boy from Israel studied to be a rabbi, was saved by rock and roll, and became one of the most notorious rock stars the world has ever seen.Before Gene Simmons there was Chaim Witz, a boy from Haifa, Israel, who had no inkling of the life that lay ahead of him. In vivid detail Gene recounts his childhood growing up in Haifa under the watchful eye of his beloved, strong-willed mother, a concentration camp survivor; his adolescent years attending a Jewish theological center for rabbinical studies in Brooklyn; his love of all things American, including comic books, superheroes, and cowboys; and his early fascination with girls and sex, which prompted him to start a rock band in school after he saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. KISS and Make-Up is not just the classic story of achieving the American dream through the eyes of an immigrant boy making good, but a juicy, rollicking rock and roll read that takes you along for the ride of your life with KISS, from the 1970s, when they were the biggest band in the world, through the '80s, when they took off their world-famous war paint, and into the '90s, when they came back bigger and badder than ever to become the number one touring band in the world. In his own irreverent, unapologetic voice, Gene talks about the girls (4,600 of them and counting); his tight bond with KISS cofounder Paul Stanley; the struggles he and Paul had with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss and their departures from the group; the new band members and Eric Carr's untimely death; the enormous love and affection he has for the people who put him there in the first place--the KISS Army and the ever-loyal KISS fans around the world; his love life, including stories about his relationships with Cher and Diana Ross and with Shannon Tweed, Playmate of the Year, mother of his son and daughter, and his companion of eighteen years; and much more. Full of dozens of photographs, many never-before-seen pictures from Gene's private collection, KISS and Make-Up is a surprising, intimate look at the man behind the mask. For the first time Gene reveals all the facets of his complex personality--son, rock star, actor, record producer, businessman, ladies' man, devoted father, and now author.\n...more", "genre": ["Music", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Biography Memoir", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Audiobook", "Music", "Rock N Roll", "History", "Biography", "Music Biography"], "author": "Gene Simmons", "rating": "3.75", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 1231390, "title": "Callie's Tally: An Accounting of Baby's First Year", "blurb": "According to reports, it costs upwards of $190,000 just to get a child to the point that college is a possibility.

In the course of the book, Weiss plumbs the depths of family life: there is the early death of his beloved sister Margit, the difficult relationship with his parents, the fantasies of adolescence and youth, all set in the midst of an increasing anti-Semitism, which forces the Weiss family to move again and again, a peripatetic existence that only intensifies the narrator's growing restlessness. The young narrator is largely oblivious to world events and focused instead on becoming an artist, an ambition frustrated generally by his milieu and specifically by his mother, who, herself a former actress, destroys his paintings during one of the family's moves. In the end, he turns to an older mentor, Harry Haller, a fictionalized portrait of Hermann Hesse, who encouraged and supported Weiss, and with Haller's example before him, the narrator takes his first steps towards a truly independent life.

In this new contribution to the anthropology of the state, Yael Navaro-Yashin brings recent poststructuralist and psychoanalytic theory to bear on the study of the political. Delving deeper than studies of nationalist discourse that would focus on consciously articulated narratives of political identity, the author explores sites of fantasy in the public-political domain of Istanbul.The book focuses on the conflict over secularism in the aftermath of an Islamist victory in the city's municipalities. In contrast with studies that would problematize and objectify religious movements, the author examines the agency of secularists under a state widely known for its secularist policies. The complexity and dynamism of the context studied moves well beyond scholarly distinctions between secularity and religion, as well as state and society. Here, secularism and Islamism emerge as different guises for a culture of statism where people from society compete to claim Turkish culture for themselves and their life practices.

Once photography is understood as a kind of technology, Maynard argues, insights about technology may be applied to provide the general perspective on photography that has been missing.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Theory", "Art", "Photography"], "author": "Patrick Maynard", "rating": "3.33", "pages": "352"}, {"id": 1233016, "title": "Un truc soi-disant super auquel on ne me reprendra pas", "blurb": "Sept textes sur des sujets aussi divers que la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, le tennis, la Foire de l'Illinois o\u00f9 l'on discute de Barthes, Derrida et Foucault, la th\u00e9orie de la litt\u00e9rature post-moderne, les films de David Lynch...", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Essays", "Humor", "Short Stories", "Memoir", "American", "Philosophy"], "author": "David Foster Wallace", "rating": "4.23", "pages": "554"}, {"id": 1233061, "title": "The Age of Wire and String: Stories", "blurb": "A debut collection of short stories by Ben Marcus that draw on the familiar everyday world of food, the weather, shelter, and more, all radically altered in terms of their relationship to one another and the reader.

Das Buch entdeckt die Freiheit, die wir haben - ob wir wollen oder nicht -, wieder neu. Es ist klar bis zur Sch\u00f6nheit und spannend wie ein Roman. R\u00fcdiger SafranskiPeter Bieris Handwerk der Freiheit ist ein ungew\u00f6hnliches philosophisches Buch, denn die vorgebrachten Argumente sind eingebettet in anschauliche Beispiele. So zieht sich die Geschichte von Fjodor Dostojewskis Romanfigur Raskolnikow, der eine Pfandleiherin ermordet, wie ein roter Faden durch die verschiedenen Etappen der Lekt\u00fcre und verdeutlicht die jeweils anstehenden Argumentationsschritte.Bieri ist geb\u00fcrtiger Schweizer und hat derzeit eine Professur f\u00fcr Philosophie an der Freien Universit\u00e4t Berlin inne. Seine Position l\u00e4sst sich so zusammenfassen: Die Freiheit des Willens ist durchgehend an Bedingungen gekn\u00fcpft. Von Unfreiheit unterscheidet sie sich durch die Art und Weise, wie der Wille bedingt ist. Frei ist dieser genau dann, wenn er durch die eigenen Urteile bestimmt wird. Diese Urteile bringt jeder Mensch in einem Prozess des \u00dcberlegens aus Motiven, Wahrnehmungen, Zukunftsvorstellungen und so weiter hervor. Dieser Standpunkt ist in der Philosophie als Kompatibilismus bekannt: Unsere Willensfreiheit ist mit der M\u00f6glichkeit vereinbar (kompatibel), dass sie in ein Netzwerk von Bedingungen in unserer Welt eingebettet ist, das auch unsere Urteile und Handlungen einschlie\u00dft.Am Ende nimmt Peter Bieri seinen Anfangsfaden noch einmal auf: Wenn Freiheit darin besteht, dass unser Wille durch unser eigenes Urteil bestimmt ist, dann ist Freiheit etwas, das wir uns erarbeiten m\u00fcssen und das eine ganz eigene Geschicklichkeit erfordert. Und dies genau stand wohl auch bei der Auswahl des Buchtitels im Hintergrund.Hier zeigt sich, dass das Philosophieren des Schweizer Philosophen am Sp\u00e4twerk Ludwig Wittgensteins (1889-1951) und mehr noch an den Arbeiten des Amerikaners Wilfrid Sellars (1912-1989) geschult wurde: Bieri versteht Philosophie als analytische Betrachtung derjenigen Erfahrungen, die unser Selbstbild formen. Damit m\u00f6chte er verhindern, dass wir diese Eindr\u00fccke falsch auslegen. Wer dem Autor auf seiner philosophischen Reise folgt, hat am Ende nicht nur ein Bild seiner selbst ausgearbeitet - er erf\u00e4hrt auch sich selbst in einem anderen Licht. Denn unser Selbstbild wirkt sich wiederum auf die Erfahrungen aus, die wir machen.Rezensent: Prof. Dr. Michael Esfeld Sie sind ein freier Mensch! Sie k\u00f6nnen dieses Buch jetzt bestellen oder aber nicht. Was so einfach klingt, ist in Wahrheit eines der kniffligsten Probleme der Philosophie, an dem sich schon geniale K\u00f6pfe wie Immanuel Kant abgearbeitet haben. Der Berliner Philosophieprofessor Peter Bieri geht scheinbar unbek\u00fcmmert an das Thema der Willensfreiheit heran und beschlie\u00dft, kein akademisches Buch zu schreiben, das den Leser \u00fcber die Schlachtfelder der Fachliteratur schleift. Auf den \u00fcber 420 Seiten Text findet sich tats\u00e4chlich keine Zitat, kein Name eines anderen Philosophen. Und was er im Vorwort ank\u00fcndigt -- \u00fcber ein zum Verzweifeln komplexes Thema in einfacher, m\u00fchelos flie\u00dfender Sprache schreiben --, ist Bieri hinrei\u00dfend gut gelungen.Der Grund daf\u00fcr ist wohl in der zweiten Leidenschaft des aus der Schweiz stammenden Philosophen zu suchen -- dem Schreiben von Romanen (zuletzt Der Klavierstimmer unter seinem Pseudonym Pascal Mercier). Analytische und erz\u00e4hlerische Passagen sind miteinander verwoben. Und die vielen Beispiele und Gedankenexperimente sind nie blo\u00dfe Illustrationen f\u00fcr etwas, das begrifflich und gedanklich bereits entschieden ist. Das Stellen Sie sich vor... am Anfang vieler Abs\u00e4tze l\u00e4dt den Leser ein, unterschiedlichste Situationen des Erlebens von Freiheit oder Unfreiheit mit dem Autor gedanklich durch zu spielen. In bester ph\u00e4nomenologischer Tradition muss sich das Denken, das an allgemeinsten Begriffen wie Freiheit, Handeln, Entscheiden oder dem Unterschied zwischen Wollen und W\u00fcnschen ansetzt, in konkreten Alltagssituationen beweisen und festmachen lassen.Warum aber ist die Freiheit des Willens ein Handwerk? Weil sie uns nicht in die Wiege gelegt ist oder wir qua Menschsein zur Freiheit verurteilt sind, wie Sartre meinte. Vielmehr m\u00fcssen wir sie uns erarbeiten, brauchen Fantasie, Selbstreflexion, Engagement und Verantwortung um die Freiheit unseres Willens zu entdecken und zu verfeinern. Also schon fast eine Kunst -- so wie es bestimmt eine Kunst ist, solche B\u00fccher zu schreiben, bei denen philosophische Tiefe und Genauigkeit mit sprachlicher Eleganz und Lesbarkeit eine wundervolle Verbindung eingehen. --Christian Stahl\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Theory", "European Literature", "German Literature"], "author": "Peter Bieri", "rating": "3.79", "pages": "445"}, {"id": 1233671, "title": "Traumzeit", "blurb": "Einmalige E-Book Aktion!

One side says images are basically pictures in the head. The other side says they are like the symbol structures in computers. If the picture-in-the-head theorists are right, then computers will never be able to think like people. This book contains the most intelligible and incisive articles in the debate, articles by cognitive psychologists, computer scientists and philosophers. The most exciting imagery phenomena are described, phenomena that indicate that mental images can be rotated and scanned, that smaller images are harder to see than larger ones, that when mental images are made larger they eventually overflow, that the screen they overflow from has a determinable shape (elliptical), and that this screen subtends a determinate visual angle, the angle of vision of the mind's eye. Such experiments cry out for explanation. If images are pictures in the head, who (or what) looks at them? Why haven't brain scientists found them? Such questions are the subject of the great debate.

Following his acclaimed America and Cool Memories, this book is the third in a series of personal records in hyperreality.

In this wide-ranging discussion of events and ideas, Baudrillard moves between poetry and waterfalls, strikes and stealth bombers, Freud and La Cicciolina, shadows and simulacra, deconstruction and the zodiac, Reagan\u2019s smile and Kennedy\u2019s death, the \u201ccurse\u201d on South America and the future of the West, the last tango of French intellectual life and the exemplary disappearing act of Italian politics.

Over the next three decades, he served as the chief theoretician and propagandist for Marxism in France. During these years, which ended with the dramatic suicides of Lafargue and his wife, French socialism, and the Marxist party within it, became a significant political force.In an earlier volume, Paul Lafargue and the Founding of French Marxism, 1842-1882, Leslie Derfler emphasized family identity and the origin of French Marxism. Here, he explores Lafargue's political strategies, specifically his break with party co-founder Jules Guesde in the Boulanger and Dreyfus episodes and over the question of socialist-syndicalist relations. Derfler shows Lafargue's importance as both political activist and theorist. He describes Lafargue's role in the formulation of such strategies as the promotion of a Second Workingmen's International, the pursuit of reform within the framework of the existent state but opposition to any socialist participation in nonsocialist governments, and the subordination of trade unionism to political action. He emphasizes Lafargue's pioneering efforts to apply Marxist methods of analysis to questions of anthropology, aesthetics, and literary criticism.Despite the crucial part they played in the social and political changes of the past century and the heritage they left, the first French Marxists are not widely known, especially in the English-speaking world.

Testimonies offer proof of African Americans' vast technical skills in producing cloth and clothing, which served both as a fundamental reflection of the peoples' Afrocentric craftsmanship and aesthetic sensibilities, and as a reaction to their particular place in American society. Previous work on clothing in this period has tended to focus on white viewpoints, and as a consequence the dress worn by the enslaved has generally been seen as a static standard imposed by white overlords. This excellent study departs from conventional interpretations to show that the clothing of the enslaved changed over time, served multiple functions and represented customs and attitudes which evolved distinctly from within African American communities.

Her riveting novels portray the timeless struggle of good and evil with matchless intensity and insight. Now, in the sequel to her critically acclaimed Dragonshadow, Hambly works her most compelling magic yet. The result is a masterpiece of dark fantasy, a courageous and compassionate journey through the hells of the human heart . . . and beyond.Once the most powerful mage in the land, Jenny Waynest is now a broken woman. Though sickened by the memory of how the demon Amayon had possessed her body to slake his sadistic lusts, she knows a part of her was corrupted by his touch. That part mourns the demon's defeat and longs for his return, though he has already cost her everything she holds dear: the trust of her husband, Lord John Aversin; the chance to be a mother to her mage-born son; and the magic that had given her life its purpose.Lord John has torments of his own: memories of the beautiful and cruel Aohila, demon queen of a rival hell, whom he'd tricked into providing the help he needed to free Jenny. Now, condemned to death for trafficking with demons, John cannot forgive Jenny for what she suffered. Nor can he forgive himself--for opening the door to a far greater evil . . . an evil that still haunts his dreams. And not only his dreams . . .For a vengeful Aohila needs mortal aid in realms beyond her power, and who better to provide it than Lord John? Blackmailed into cooperating, John is given a guide: none other than Amayon, the demon he'd driven out of Jenny and into the waiting claws of the demon queen. Now, forced to put his life in the hands of a creature he dare not trust by a monster he dare not disobey, John must fight his way through unimaginable horrors in quest of a prize that may doom the world he has left behind . . .

Beard's memories of the next 30 years are no less sharp and wry, powered by antic melancholy, perfect juxtapositions, and the push of love. When she was little, the words of grown-ups rarely made sense, and even now, with the exception of her best friend and a few colleagues, not much seems to have changed.  In the title story, Beard and her best friend, now 38, still spend forever on the phone, an activity they perfected in junior high and that is now possible thanks to an office WATS line. Hindsight easily renders their seventh-grade ex nihilo obsession with a ninth grader extraordinaire foolish, along with most encounters with the boys of their youth. But their current relations with men are really no less absurd, as they realize while listening to Beard's latest possibility leave an answering-machine message: I don't know whether to faint or kill myself. Elizabeth laughs unbecomingly. I put both hands around my own neck. We are no longer bored.  The Boys of My Youth is filled with family picnics, small celebrations, and fragility. Beard knows that her teenage efforts to have a better personality were as futile as her later attempt at practicing being snotty, in anticipation of being dumped by my husband, but that doesn't make her any less fond of her younger self. And she has the same affection, and irritation, for her family, who slowly emerge in story after story. In Waiting, she and her older sister try to keep calm as their mother is dying: I hold two fingers up to remind her of how much longer she needs to keep this up, to pay attention. She holds up one finger, guess which one, to remind me of who's the oldest, who's the boss. I would love more than anything to slap her.  There isn't a weak piece in this collection, which includes the world's most perfect description of the agonies of having your hair washed--at age 3--and the ecstasies of one encounter near the Mexican border. The car is a boiling cauldron. The coyote stands scruffy and skittish, like a wild dingo dog I met once, who bit everything in sight, wagging his tail like a maniac. Eric slides the camera to me and puts a hand on my arm. He whispers in my ear. I nod. I love dogs better than anything else on earth, next to cigarettes and a couple of people.  Beard often edges from serious laughter to high seriousness and back again. The Fourth State of Matter is perhaps the book's standout, a narrative about space physicists; invading squirrels; a beautiful, dying dog; a vanished husband; and, alas, a seminar turned 12-minute massacre. On November 1, 1991, she leaves work early and passes by the disappointed graduate student who will later that day gun down eight members of the University of Iowa physics depart. Her piece is complex and heartbreaking, a master conduit of emotion and information. As always, Beard knows the rich value of the minor ritual. Earlier, she had recalled playing Maserati with her collie: I'd grab her nose like a gearshift and put her through all the gears, firstsecondthirdfourth, until we were going a hundred miles an hour through town. She thought it was funny. After the newslady finally confirms her colleagues' deaths, Maserati again figures: We sit by the tub. She lifts her long nose to my face and I take her muzzle and we move through the gears slowly; first second third fourth, all the way through town, until what has happened has happened and we know it has happened.\n...more", "genre": ["Autobiography", "Memoir", "Writing", "Essays", "Nonfiction", "Short Stories", "Biography Memoir", "Womens", "Contemporary", "Biography", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Language", "Writing"], "author": "Jo Ann Beard", "rating": "4.12", "pages": null}, {"id": 1241377, "title": "Forbidden Pleasures", "blurb": "Replacing a social life with a career, bestselling romance novelist Emily Shann has gotten by on a vivid imagination, hiding a shocking secret that not even her publisher suspects -- until she's asked to write something that's hotter, sexier, more explicit, and true to life.

In recent years, however, the study of affect has come into its own as a vigorous, respectable, and productive branch of scientific psychology, and with this shift has come a new interest in emotions such as shame, guilt, embarrassment, and pride. This volume provides a comprehensive, in-depth review of the current theoretical and empirical literature on these emotions. It brings together contributions from leading researchers and theoreticians from the fields of developmental psychology, clinical psychology, psychiatry, and sociology, reflecting the emerging coherence in this area of study.The introduction provides a general framework for conceptualization and research on the self-conscious emotions. The book then addresses developmental issues, including the nature of these affective experiences among children, from late infancy to middle childhood, and implications for children's psychosocial functioning. Detailed explorations of the relationship of self-conscious emotions to aspects of social behavior and the social environment and to various types of psychopathology are also presented. Chapters demonstrate how an understanding of self-conscious emotions can greatly enhance the treatment of a wide range of maladaptive patterns of behavior, including marital conflict, depression, anxiety, and antisocial behavior. The final section discusses cross-cultural continuities and discontinuities in self-conscious affect. Throughout, the book highlights the need for innovative and diverse methodologies to systematically study the nature and functions of these feelings.The unique focus on empirical approaches makes this work an invaluable resource for the growing number of researchers interested in the study of self-conscious affect and social behavior. Demonstrating the wide-ranging implications of this research for clinical practice, the book will interest practitioners in clinical psychology, psychiatry, and developmental psychology. In addition, Self-Conscious Emotions will benefit professionals in social psychology, sociology, and anthropology, and will serve as useful text for courses in the psychology of emotion, personality and emotion, and cultural psychology. \n...more", "genre": ["Psychology"], "author": "June Price Tangney", "rating": "3.83", "pages": "542"}, {"id": 1241527, "title": "The Season of Gold", "blurb": "\u201cGather round.

After all, although humans and dogs share a remarkable relationship that is unique in the animal world, we are still two entirely different species, each shaped by our individual evolutionary heritage. Quite simply, humans are primates and dogs are canids (like wolves, coyotes, and foxes). Since we each speak a different native tongue, a lot gets lost in the translation. The Other End of the Leash demonstrates how even the slightest changes in your voice and the way you stand can help your dog understand what you want. Once you start to think about your own behavior from the perspective of your dog, you'll understand why much of what appears to be doggy-disobedience is simply a case of miscommunication. Inside you will learn- How to use your voice so that your dog is more likely to do what you ask.- Why getting dominance over your dog is a bad idea.- Why rough and tumble primate play can lead to trouble-and how to play with your dog in ways that are fun and keep him out of trouble.- How dogs and humans share personality types-and why most dogs want to live with benevolent leaders rather than alphawannabees! In her own insightful, compelling style, Patricia McConnell combines wonderful true stories about people and dogs with a new, accessible scientific perspective on how they should behave around each other.

The novel is counted as one of 100 best books of the 20th century.Joseph Conrad (1857-1924), was a Polish author who wrote in English after settling in England. Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties. He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent world. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature.Contents: Lord JimMemoirs & Letters:A Personal Record; or Some ReminiscencesThe Mirror of the SeaNotes on Life & LettersBiography & Critical Essays:Joseph Conrad (A Biography) by Hugh WalpoleJoseph Conrad by John Albert MacyA Conrad Miscellany by John Albert MacyJoseph Conrad by Virginia Woolf", "genre": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Literature", "Adventure", "Novels", "Historical Fiction", "British Literature"], "author": "Joseph Conrad", "rating": "3.62", "pages": "455"}, {"id": 1242101, "title": "Demonstrating to Win!: The Indispensable Guide for Demonstrating Software", "blurb": "The demonstration or presentation of complex products like technology or medical devices is like leading a person over a treacherous ravine.

Around 1909 he painted the first of his Expressionist portraits, which seem to reveal their sitters' emotional life. The restless draftsmanship and broken patterns of color in these likenesses predict the emergence of the artist's mature style in such paintings as Bride of the Wind of 1914. Seriously wounded in World War I, Kokoschka produced little work until 1924, when he began a series of journeys through Europe and North Africa that refreshed his creative spirit. During this period he embarked on a number of color experiments, particularly in landscape paintings, in which he combined a traditional organization of the painting's space seen from a high viewpoint with brilliant colors, set forth with his characteristic energetic brushwork. These visionary landscapes communicate a passionate vision, seeming at times exhilarated, at times anguished. In the 1930s, the artist's work was condemned by the Nazi regime as degenerate and his paintings in public collections were confiscated.

The Winter Queen, his first novel to win U.S. release, was a police procedural, introducing a young but brilliant detective named Erast Petrovich Fandorin, serving in 1876 Moscow. However, Murder on the Leviathan (actually the third entry in the Fandorin series, but published second in the States) was quite different--an homage to formulaic Golden Age whodunits, taking place on a luxurious steamship. Now comes The Turkish Gambit, which is more a combination of war novel and romance, rather than crime fiction, with the majority of its mysteries so transparent as to barely merit the label. The action here takes place in 1877 and 1878, on the Balkan front of a military conflict pitting tsarist Russia against the Ottoman Empire. Into this realm of posturing commanders and the foreign journalists whose florid prose makes those officers look better (or worse) than they really are ride Fandorin, now with the diplomatic corps, and Varya Suvorova, a strong-willed 22-year-old telegraphist hoping to reunite on the battlefield with her future fianc\u00e9, an army volunteer. But Varya's efforts are frustrated when her intended is accused of espionage. His release can only be won by identifying the real informant-cum-saboteur, in which task Varya is willing to cooperate with Fandorin, despite her dislike of the stuttering and apparently cold, disagreeable former policeman. Amid profuse digressions concerning Turkish politics, female suffrage, and the harem system (without it many women would quite simply starve to death), Varya--trailed by lustful correspondents--investigates a suspicious colonel in Bucharest, only to become party to a deadly duel. A pair of officers are subsequently murdered, a guilt-ridden soldier hangs himself, and a British plot against Russia is alleged. Akunin (the pseudonym of Grigory Chkhartishvili) nimbly portrays the tumultuous atmosphere of 19th-century combat, complete with ear-splitting cannon blasts and hard-charging cossacks. His dialogue is frequently clever, and in Varya he has created a woman fully capable of steering yarns and stopping hearts. Yet The Turkish Gambit is so laden with expendable exchanges, trivial players, and hieings off to hither and yon, that the reader's interest may wane well short of this story's dramatic climax. --J.

Maps imply a truth, but that truth can be quite skewed depending on the viewpoint of the map creator. This book takes a hard look at truth by carefully inspecting some familiar, and not-so-familiar, map images and exploring their significance. The normally staid world of geographers is unusually excited by this dramatic new approach to the meaning of images. Seeing Through Maps, however, extends beyond cartography. The book discusses how map projections provide information about countries, cultures, the world's peoples and their history. It also explains the principles and hidden messages contained in a number of unique maps and provocative images: Peters' Equal Area Projection, Van Sant's GeoSphere Map; Fuller's Dymaxion Map; a Toronto-centered world map; Minard's map of Napoleon's march on Moscow; Petit's map of African slave trading routes; a global warming map; and some intriguing, mind-stretching maps with south on top.

In World War II, nearly 145,000 men served in the Naval Armed Guard as Gunner's Mates, Coxswains and Boatswains, Radiomen, Signalmen, an occasional Pharmacist's Mate, and toward the end of the war a few radarmen. The Naval Armed Guard served on more than 6,000 cargo ships, tankers, troop ships, and other merchant vessels, and took part in every major campaign of World War II in both the European and Pacific theaters. The U.S. Navy Armed Guard was disbanded after the war.Award-winning Pacific war historian William L. McGee combines fact with memoir to tell his story of service in the Naval Armed Guard in the Pacific theater of WWII. Written in his signature journalistic and straightforward style, he draws on his journal, declassified documents, archival research, and interviews with more than a hundred former shipmates and others who served in the Naval Armed Guard.I would like to thank Bill and his co-author/wife Sandra for their work to preserve the history of the U.S. Navy Armed Guard and Merchant Marines, so future generations may read about what both crews did in World War II.

And we are the most fortunate generation that ever will.\u201d\u2014George Monbiot\n\nWhat George Monbiot means by this is that our civilization has leveraged the awesome power of fossil energy to create a world that only a short time ago would have been nearly unimaginable. Our health, our wealth, our leisure, our freedom from tyranny and struggle, are all benefits bestowed upon us by harnessed energy of oil and coal. But the price of these gifts has been a growing environmental crisis. Our atmosphere is filling up with carbon dioxide, which is released by the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide traps the sun\u2019s heat, causing the temperature of our planet to rise. The reason why future generations are unlikely to be as fortunate as us is that fossil energy is just too good to be true. We cannot go on enjoying the benefits of this dirty energy. We must either address the problem, which will be a tough challenge involving many sacrifices, or ignore it, with unthinkable consequences. George Monbiot\u2019s Heat: How to Stop the Planet from Burning  marks an important moment in our civilization\u2019s thinking about global warming. The question is no longer whether climate change is actually happening. The question is what to do about it. Monbiot offers an ambitious and far-reaching program to cut our carbon dioxide emissions to the point where the environmental scales start tipping away from catastrophe. (But not before he devotes a chapter to unmasking the vested interests that have spent fortunes funding the specious science of the climate change deniers.)He does not pretend it will be easy. The threshold for disaster, he argues, is a rise of two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels. Past two degrees, science tells us, the ability to control climate change passes out of our hands. At that point, the world\u2019s forests will fall into decline, changing cloud formation patterns and releasing the billions of tons of carbon the trees store. Past two degrees, the permafrost begins to thaw, releasing billions of tons of methane, a greenhouse gas far more destructive than CO2. At the same point, the polar ice begins to melt, affecting ocean currents and water levels. This is called a \u201cpositive feedback loop,\u201d and it means that once we\u2019ve passed two degrees, nothing can be done to stop it rising to three. And once we hit three, four will follow. Two degrees is also the point at which the globe slides towards increasing water scarcity and, eventually, food deficit. And the fact is, we\u2019re already seeing the consequences of climate change around the globe: collapsing ice shelves, the failure of the cyclical rains in Eastern Africa, drought in Australia, the spread of tropical diseases into new territory as temperatures rise, pollution of aquifers with salt water in Bangladesh. Global temperatures have already risen 0.6 of a degree, causing huge damage to the natural environment and inflicting suffering on vast numbers of people. The only way to avoid further devastation, and forestall the catastrophe of positive feedback, Monbiot argues, is a 90% cut in CO2 emissions in the rich nations of the world by 2030. In other words, our response will have to be immediate, and it will have to be decisive.But where to start?Monbiot starts at home, where we have most control. Though he draws his examples from the UK, and commends Canadians for our superior building standards, he makes a damning case that the buildings we live and work in squander energy. Since our heat and electricity produce CO2, nearly every bit of heat and power we waste (like nearly every bit of heat and power we use) commits us to greenhouse gas emissions. Monbiot finds ways for us to build, and live, so much better that we can cut emissions at home by the required 90%.He then looks at the source of our electricity, and evaluates the arguments for both local micro-generation (for example, solar photovoltaic panels and small wind turbines), and renewable energy for the grid. His research leads him to some unexpected discoveries, but he finds a way to trim our emissions by the necessary margin.Another obvious source of CO2 emissions is our transportation \u2013 the cars we drive and the flights we take. A little ingenuity, he argues, will allow us to deal with the former. But the latter, he acknowledges, is shaping up to be the Achilles heel of all efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.A couple of less obvious major sources of CO2 are the retail and construction industries. Big box stores, with their inefficient designs, their racks of heaters, air conditioners, and blazing lights (to say nothing of the sprawling parking lots full of cars that drive back and forth on shopping trips), are simply inconsistent with a low-carbon future. But Monbiot has a thoughtful and surprisingly simple solution. Similarly, the concrete industry, that backbone of all new construction, emits millions of tons each year as a consequence of the immense heat and chemical processes involved in the manufacturing process. Though the solution here is not as ready to hand, it is still possible. In short, the scale of the changes before us is staggering, as is the size of the problem. But Monbiot ends on a note of hope. We have shown ourselves to be capable of enormous ingenuity and great feats of cooperation and sacrifice when confronted with a serious threat. The Second World War provides countless examples of citizens and engineers doing the supposedly impossible in order to get the job done. Fighting climate change will not require young men to die in battle, but a failure to tackle the problem urgently and with all the determination we can muster will cost uncountable lives. There is no reason to think we will do less when faced with a threat to the sustainability of all life on the planet than we did when faced with a threat to our political and ethical values. Monbiot argues there is no time to waste. As he has said himself, \u201cwe are the last generation that can make this happen, and this is the last possible moment at which we can make it happen.\u201dFrom the Hardcover edition.", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Environment", "Science", "Climate Change", "Sustainability", "Politics", "Economics"], "author": "George Monbiot", "rating": "4.06", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 1244946, "title": "Nichivo: Tales from the Russian Front 1941-43", "blurb": "Here is the true, poetic, and passionately told story of the civilians caught between the Soviet and German armies in World War II.

In a series of case studies\u2014including Classical Greece, Renaissance Italy and the Portuguese and Spanish empires\u2014Justin Rosenberg shows how the historical-materialist analysis of societies is a surer guide to understanding geopolitical systems than the technical theories of realist international relations. In each case, he draws attention to the correspondence between the form of the geopolitical system and the character of the societies composing it.In the final section of the book, the tools forged in these explorations are employed to analyze the contemporary international system, with striking results. Rosenberg demonstrates that the distinctive properties of the sovereign-states system are best understood as corresponding to the social structures of capitalist society. In this light, realism emerges as incapable of explaining what it has always insisted is the central feature of the international system\u2014namely, the balance of power. On the other hand, it is argued that Marx\u2019s social theory of value, conventionally regarded as an account of hierarchical class domination, provides the deepest understanding of the core international relations theme of \u201canarchy.\u201dProvocative and unconventional, The Empire of Civil Society\u00a0brilliantly turns orthodox international relations on its head.", "genre": ["Politics", "International Relations", "History"], "author": "Justin Rosenberg", "rating": "3.94", "pages": "236"}, {"id": 1245205, "title": "Boyd K.

Barnes traces this story through the mid-nineteenth century, in both Europe and, eventually, the United States.

But what of the American Civil War and the question of inspired Confederate leadership? The prevailing view holds that Robert E. Lee was the Confederacy's preeminent military strategist--the South's mythic hero who achieved all that was possible against vastly superior forces. This fresh and authoritative account of the Civil War's first two years challenges that assumption. Drawing on neglected primary sources it demonstrates that Lee's decision to block Stonewall Jackson's plans for an invasion of the North made defeat certain.On four separate occasions, Jackson called for a strike across the Potomac behind Washington to force Federal forces to protect the capital, leaving Baltimore and Philadelphia unprotected and Northern railroads and industry vulnerable to direct attack. Jackson, not Lee, as this authoritative reconstruction of the War's legendary battles in Virginia and Maryland--First and Second Manassas (Bull Run), the Valley Campaign battles, the Seven Days, Antietam (Sharpsburg), Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville-- makes plain, possessed the gifts common to only a handful of history's great commanders. The astute and daring Jackson understood after First Manassas that victory for the weaker army was possible only if its leaders could mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy. Further, the resourceful and opportunistic general recognized that the South's only hope was to make war so painful that the North would accept Southern independence.Lee, on the other hand, did not appreciate the element of surprise and the strategic advantage of strikes behind Washington; nor did he understand how to isolate and destroy an enemy within his grasp. Further, his inability at the Seven Days--and, more destructively, at Gettysburg--to secure strong defensive positions resulted in the needless slaughter of tens of thousands of irreplaceable Confederates. Yet Jackson, who understood the dangers of the rifle's minie ball to the attacker and how to avoid ill-advised frontal attacks, knew when to go for the jugular. Jackson's ruthlessly efficient plan against Hooker at Chancellorsville, as it unfolds herein, called for nothing less than the destruction of the Army of the Potomac. After Jackson surprised and defeated Hooker's larger forces, he called for an attack on the Federal rear to cut off its line of retreat. At the eleventh hour of his most spectacular victory at Chancellorsville, Jackson was cut down by friendly fire; his daring plan to destroy Hooker's army, like his plan to seal off Washington by a northern invasion, denied. With Jackson's death the South lost his victories and the clear-eyed vision of the one man who could have changed the course of America's bloodiest war.

He thus explores a wide range of topics that clarify the history of southern--and American--religion: the presuppositions of liberalism and the logic of conservatism; the influence of Scottish Common-Sense Philosophers, British theologians, and German Biblical critics; the foundations and functions of southern social ethics; the didactic uses of ritual; and the continuing effort of nineteenth-century theologians to demonstrate the reasonableness of both the Christian religion and the whole natural order. In this minutely documented study, Professor Holifield, a brilliant . . . scholar, demolishes the myth that the Old South's clergy were ardent devotees of emotional religion but showed very little interest in a rational faith. In fact, the urban areas contained a considerable number of Catholic and Protestant leaders who were well acquainted with theological developments on the Continent and in Great Britain, and who produced carefully reasoned works in theology and moral philosophy. To be sure, their patterns of thought were predominantly orthodox, but they were by no means uncritical of the various types of orthodoxy.

From the moment he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972, he has been a leader in the conservative movement that has changed the course of the nation. From his years in Congress to his ascent to majority leader of the Senate -- and his decision to leave that post in the heat of controversy -- Herding Cats is the frank and revealing chronicle of a unique political life.Lott's story bridges an extraordinary time in American history. As a fraternity leader during the integration of the University of Mississippi, he helped contain the violence that accompanied James Meredith's enrollment as the university's first African American student. As a congressman during Watergate, he mounted a fierce defense of Richard Nixon -- until Gerald Ford quietly counseled him to think twice. A passionate advocate of smaller government, Lott describes his painful choice to support Gerald Ford over his challenger Ronald Reagan in the 1976 election -- and his delight in helping lead the revolution that followed Reagan's win in 1980.Yet it was in his dramatic engagements with the Clinton administration that Lott found his greatest victories -- and challenges. Working in secret through political adviser Dick Morris, Lott reveals, he persuaded Clinton to accept health insurance and welfare reform laws, along with spending cuts that balanced the national budget. But he was aghast when years of work on a tobacco settlement were scuttled by the White House in 1997 -- possibly because of Al Gore's desire to exploit tobacco as a political issue. With surprising candor, Lott portrays his fruitful working partnership with Democratic leader Tom Daschle during the Clinton impeachment, and again in the hours after the attacks of September 11, 2001. And he describes in painful detail his decision to resign as majority leader after his remarks at Senator Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party -- a move he made when it became clear that the Bush White House had circled the wagons against him.Marked by the same straight-talking style and good humor he has shown throughout his career in public service, Trent Lott's Herding Cats is the memoir of a true master of American political life.", "genre": ["Biography", "Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Politics", "Memoir", "History", "American History"], "author": "Trent Lott", "rating": "3.36", "pages": "320"}, {"id": 1247985, "title": "Managing People Is Like Herding Cats", "blurb": "This collection spells out the dilemmas facing our leaderless society, details the qualities that successful leaders must have, and explores the challenges that today's leaders must face as they move toward change.

B. Lippincott Company 192,8 IKT DEDICATED TO R. B. CUNNINGHAME-GRAHAM PREFACE THIS essay is not a biography, still less a chronicle. It is an attempt to portray a character of capital interest to English and European History, of which our academic historians give but a caricature. Were it either a biography or a chronicle, a great mass of detail would have been added, with which the book has no concern. Were it a biography, it would have been essential to describe all the main facts of the subjects life were it a chronicle, it would have had to include a conspectus of the world contemporary with James at home and abroad and to give the sequence of events in a regular and dated order. Neither of. these tasks appears in the pages that follow. Thus, James was conspicuous and successful as a British Aomiral in two great naval engagements the most important of those fought by the fleet which he had created, and the chief actions of the century. I have given the story of one only, as typical of his attitude in command. He was attacked and betrayed by a good score of men in the small clique of great fortunes all allied by marriage which destroyed the ancient monarchy of the English. I have described but two, as typical of their set, Shaftesbury and his brother-in-law Sunderland. He presided over, and in great part initiated, the making 6f the British Navy his chief work. That in itself would be material for a volume. I have given it but a chapter, and in that chapter have emphasized but two main points his new corps of professional officers j his new idea of a National Fleetindependent of pressed merchant auxiliaries. But these are sufficient to show his creative role iii the setting up of that service. The characters and careers of his numerous vii PREFACE mistresses would be essential to a life I have concerned myself only with the very difficult problem of his own emotions in such amours, for that is the point of character. I have thus deliberately selected, because it is surely by such selection of special points in connexion with his temperament, achievement and failures that he can be best presented and, I think, in no other way. But that he should be presented truly is of the first value in understanding England during and sincd his day. The Revolution of 1688 completed the work of the Refor mation. From it dates the Modern Aristocratic England which is nearly all the nineteenth century and our own can conceive of as English. To know the man whose failure produced that Revolution is a thing the nine teenth century and our own has hardly attempted. It is high time the attempt should be made. I trust that in doing so I have exaggerated neither his vice, nor as is the temptation in face of our academic text-books his virtues neither his capacities, which were great and remarkable, nor his deficiencies which were startlingly pronounced and, combined with certain high moral quali ties, led to his ruin.

In the box for race, they faced two choices: North Italian or South Italian. On the line requesting information on color, they wrote simply white. By World War II, the only option they had for race and color questions was white. This identification is suggestive of the many ways in which Italians became white on arrival in the United States, as Thomas A. Guglielmo demonstrates in this prize-winning book. While many suffered from racial prejudice and discrimination, they were nonetheless viewed as white, with all the privileges this color classification bestowed, in the corridors of American power--from judges to journalists, from organized labor to politicians, from race scientists to realtors. Taking the mass Italian immigration of the late 19th century as his starting point and drawing on dozens of oral histories and a diverse array of primary sources in English and Italian, Guglielmo focuses on how perceptions of Italians' race and color were shaped in one of America's great centers of immigration and labor, Chicago. His account skillfully weaves together the major events of Chicago immigrant history--the Chicago Color Riot of 1919, the rise of Italian organized crime, and the rise of industrial unionism--with national and international events--such as the rise of fascism and the Italian-Ethiopian War of 1935-36--to present the story of how Italians approached, learned, and lived race. By tracking their evolving position in the city's racial hierarchy, Guglielmo reveals the impact of racial classification--both formal and informal--on immigrants' abilities to acquire homes and jobs, start families, and gain opportunities in America. Carefully drawing the distinction between race and color, Guglielmo argues that whiteness proved Italians' most valuable asset for making it in America. Even so, Italians were reluctant to identify themselves explicitly as white until World War II. By separating examples of discrimination against Italians from the economic and social advantages they accrued from their acceptance as whites, Guglielmo counters the claims of many ethnic Americans that hard work alone enabled their extraordinary success, especially when compared to non-white groups whose upward mobility languished. A compelling story, White on Arrival contains profound implications for our understanding of race and ethnic acculturation in the United States, as well as twentieth-century immigration, urban, and political history.", "genre": ["History", "Race", "American History"], "author": "Thomas A.

Their mission: March thirty miles in an attempt to rescue 513 American and British POWs who had spent three years in a surreally hellish camp near the city of Cabanatuan. The prisoners included the last survivors of the Bataan Death March left in the camp, and their extraordinary will to live might soon count for nothing\u2014elsewhere in the Philippines, the Japanese Army had already executed American prisoners as it retreated from the advancing U.S. Army. As the Rangers stealthily moved through enemy-occupied territory, they learned that Cabanatuan had become a major transshipment point for the Japanese retreat, and instead of facing the few dozen prison guards, they could possibly confront as many as 8,000 battle-hardened enemy troops.Hampton Sides's vivid minute-by-minute narration of the raid and his chronicle of the prisoners' wrenching experiences are masterful. But Ghost Soldiers is far more than a thrilling battle saga. Hampton Sides explores the mystery of human behavior under extreme duress\u2014the resilience of the prisoners, who defied the Japanese authorities even as they endured starvation, tropical diseases, and unspeakable tortures; the violent cultural clashes with Japanese guards and soldiers steeped in the warrior ethic of Bushido; the remarkable heroism of the Rangers and Filipino guerrillas; the complex motivations of the U.S. high command, some of whom could justly be charged with abandoning the men of Bataan in 1942; and the nearly suicidal bravado of several spies, including priests and a cabaret owner, who risked their lives to help the prisoners during their long ordeal.At once a gripping depiction of men at war and a compelling story of redemption, Ghost Soldiers joins such landmark books as Flags of Our Fathers, The Greatest Generation, The Rape of Nanking, and D-Day in preserving the legacy of World War II for future generations.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "World War II", "War", "War", "Military Fiction", "Military", "Military History", "Historical", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Biography", "Adult"], "author": "Hampton Sides", "rating": "4.23", "pages": "576"}, {"id": 1249190, "title": "Spectrum 2: The Best In Contemporary Fantastic Art (Spectrum", "blurb": "As society braces for the advent of the millennium and collectively wonders about the changes it will bring, artists of the fantastic have assumed the role of pathfinders, preparing the way with their visionary interpretations of what the future holds.

The six American philosophers of technology whose work is profiled in this clear and concise introduction to the field--Albert Borgmann, Hubert Dreyfus, Andrew Feenberg, Donna Haraway, Don Ihde, and Langdon Winner--represent a new, empirical direction in the philosophical study of technology that has developed mainly in North America. In place of the grand philosophical schemes of the classical generation of European philosophers of technology (including Martin Heidgger, Jacques Ellul, and Hans Jonas), the contemporary American generation addresses concrete technological practices and the co-evolution of technology and society in modern culture. Six Dutch philosophers associated with Twente University survey and critique the full scope and development of their American colleagues' work, often illustrating shifts from earlier to more recent interests. Individual chapters focus on Borgmann's engagement with technology and everyday life; Dreyfus's work on the limits of artificial intelligence; Feenberg's perspectives on the cultural and social possibilities opened by technologies; Haraway's conception of the cyborg and its attendant blurring of boundaries; Ihde's explorations of the place of technology in the lifeworld; and Winner's fascination with the moral and political implications of modern technologies.

As a pathologist in a major metropolitan city, she has seen more than her share of corpses every day-many of them victims of violent murder. But never before has her blood run cold, and never has the grim expression dead ringer rung so terrifyingly true. Because never before has the lifeless body on the medical examiner's table been her own.Yet there can be no denying the mind-reeling evidence before her shocked eyes and those of her colleagues, including Detective Jane Rizzoli: the woman found shot to death outside Maura's home is the mirror image of Maura, down to the most intimate physical nuances. Even more chilling is the discovery that they share the same birth date and blood type. For the stunned Maura, an only child, there can be just one explanation. And when a DNA test confirms that Maura's mysterious doppelganger is in fact her twin sister, an already bizarre murder investigation becomes a disturbing and dangerous excursion into a past full of dark secrets.Searching for answers, Maura is drawn to a seaside town in Maine where other horrifying surprises await.

Since the word homosexual was coined in 1869, many scientists in a variety of fields have sought to understand same-sex intimacy. Drawing on recent insights in biology and genetics, psychiatrist Francis Mondimore set out to explore the complex landscape of sexual orientation.The result is A Natural History of Homosexuality, a generous work that synthesizes research in biology, history, psychology, and politics to explain how homosexuality has been understood and defined from ancient times until the present. Mondimore narrates tales of love and courage as well as discrimination and bigotry in settings as diverse as ancient Greece and Victorian England, early America and fin de siecle Vienna. He also tells fascinating stories about societies which accepted, incorporated, or institutionalized homosexuality into mainstream culture, stories illustrating that same-sex eroticism was often accepted as a normal aspect of human sexuality. In twentieth-century America, researchers first recognized that homosexuality might not be pathological when Alfred Kinsey and Evelyn Hooker conducted the first studies of sexuality not biased by preconceived notions of normal sexual behavior.After exploring sexual development in the human fetus, Mondimore reviews current biological research into the nature of sexual orientation and examines recent scientific findings on the role of heredity and hormones, as well as Simon LeVay's 1991 brain studies. He then turns to a very important focus: on people and their individual experiences. He explores what happens between childhood and adulthood in an individual that makes him or her come to identify himself or herself as having a sexual orientation. He also explains our current understanding of bisexuality and the transgender phenomena of transsexualism and transvestism.Finally, Mondimore analyzes the circumstances of such prominent scandals as the anti-homosexual trials of Oscar Wilde and Philip von Eulenberg, and recounts the Nazi persecution of homosexuals during the Holocaust. This far-reaching discussion includes a description of the ex-gay ministries and reparative therapy as well as the Stonewall riots and AIDS, ending with the emergence of gay pride and community.The preponderance of the scientific evidence is converging on a view which homosexual people have had of themselves for as long as any had the courage to record it, writes Mondimore. Homosexuality is a natural, abiding, normal sexuality for some people. It is not a disease state, not simply a behavior, and not subject to change.Thoughtful and readable. Dr. Mondimore tells us an enormous amount about homosexuality in a lively manner. This book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who wants to be informed about this important subject.\u2014Richard A.

This volume returns Sesame and Lilies to easy availability and reunites the two halves of the work: Of Kings\u2019 Treasuries, in which Ruskin critiques Victorian manhood, and Of Queens\u2019 Gardens, in which he counsels women to take their places as the moral guides of men and urges the parents of girls to educate them to this end.

This volume, by including the often ignored Of Kings\u2019 Treasuries, offers readers full access to Ruskin\u2019s complex and sometimes contradictory views on men and women.

Elizabeth Helsinger examines the text as a meditation on the pleasures of reading, Seth Koven gives a wide-ranging account of how Victorians read Sesame and Lilies, and Jan Marsh situates the work within controversies over educational reform.

Jacques Haeringer has revised and expanded his original cookbook to include some favorite new recipes developed since the previous edition, especially in its selection of pastries and desserts. From subtly blended soups to splendorous desserts his cookbook offers everyone an Alsatian culinary experience. The familiar and the serendipitous take their place side by side. In keeping with his tradition of personally overseeing every aspect of preparation, Franois Haeringer has reviewed all the recipes for accuracy. They detail the methods used daily by the Haeringers, but the occasional recipe that may be too time consuming is followed by Monsieur Franois's hint to the home cook, so that substitutions, variations, and alternate techniques can facilitate cooking without sacrificing flavor.\n...more", "genre": ["Food and Drink", "Cookbooks"], "author": "Jacques E.

No. I do not think it can. Thus opens Schumpeter's prologue to a section of his 1947 book, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. One might think, on the basis of the quote, that Schumpeter was a Marxist. But the analysis that led Schumpeter to his conclusion differed totally from Karl Marx's. Marx believed that capitalism would be destroyed by its enemies (the proletariat), whom capitalism had purportedly exploited, and he relished the prospect. Schumpeter believed that capitalism would be destroyed by its successes, that it would spawn a large intellectual class that made its living by attacking the very bourgeois system of private property and freedom so necessary for the intellectual class's existence. And unlike Marx, Schumpeter did not relish the destruction of capitalism.

Hopeful but unflinching in the face of such realities, Howard Ball's book focuses on international efforts to punish perpetrators of genocide and other war crimes. Combining history, politics, and critical analysis, he revisits the killing fields of Cambodia, documents the three-month Hutu machete genocide of about 800,000 Tutsi villagers in Rwanda, and casts recent headlines from Kosovo in the light of these other conflicts.Beginning with the 1899 Geneva Accords and the Armenian genocide of World War I, Ball traces efforts to create an institution to judge, punish, and ultimately deter such atrocities-particularly since World War II, since which there have been fourteen cases of genocide. He shows how international military tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo set important precedents for international criminal justice, tells what the international community learned from its failure to stop Pol Pot in Cambodia, and describes the ad hoc tribunals convened to address genocide in the Balkans and Rwanda. He then focuses on the establishment of the International Criminal Court with the Treaty of Rome in 1998 and assesses its probable future.The book also analyzes the reluctance of the United States to sanction the ICC, tracing longstanding U.S. reluctance to grant criminal justice jurisdiction to an international prosecutor. Ball examines questions of national sovereignty versus international law and reminds us that although most Americans consider such horrors to be problems of other countries, these are in fact countries in which many of our own citizens have their roots.With its unique focus on the ICC, Prosecuting War Crimes and Genocide is a work of both synthesis and advocacy that combines history and current events to make us more aware of the racist fervor with which these brutalities are carried out, more alert to the euphemisms in which they are cloaked. It forces us to ask not only whether the killing will stop, but whether humanity can prevent future genocides.", "genre": ["History"], "author": "Howard Ball", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 1254014, "title": "The Jolly Pocket Postman", "blurb": "Join the Jolly Postman with his mailbag of delightful deliveries for Dorothy from Oz, Alice from Wonderland, and other favorite storybook characters.", "genre": ["Childrens", "Picture Books", "Childrens", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Fairy Tales", "Fantasy", "Poetry", "Adventure"], "author": "Janet Ahlberg", "rating": "4.55", "pages": "19"}, {"id": 1254020, "title": "The Jolly Postman or Other People's Letters", "blurb": "A book with real letters inside!The Jolly Postman has delivered the mail...

What does the Bible say about faith and politics? How should the Church work in pluralistics societies? What are the problems with Liberation Theology? How should we understand freedom in the Church and in society?

In Origo's case, she managed to add light and color to everything she touched and left for posterity a legacy of work, biography, autobiography, and literary criticism, that have become recognized as classics of their kind.She was born into a wealthy and long-established Long Island family, the Cuttings, but her talented and beloved father (who resembled, more than a little, a character right out of Henry James) died of consumption when she was only nine.

This simple statement comprehends the ultimate reward God offers us- the gift of eternal life. But what does it really mean to be pure in heart, and how does one attain such a state of righteousness? In this book Elder Dallin H. Oaks, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, addresses these paramount questions, sharing insight and enrichment from the scriptures, from modern prophets, and from personal experiences. Emphasizing the significance of thoughts rather than of actions alone, the author examines the interdependent mental processes that make up the inner man: motives, desires, and attitudes. Stimulating chapters on motives and desires stress that we must not only do what is right. We must act for the right reasons. Why? Because we will ultimately be judged and rewarded for what we are. And what we are is the sum total of our good and our evil actions and desires. Materialism, pride and spirituality- all formed from attitudes- are examined in a discussion that strongly emphasizes the need to place spiritual considerations above temporal ones. In the same vein Elder Oaks searchingly describes the mental attitude necessary to true worship of God. His final chapter focuses on what we must do to become pure in heart- to cleanse the inner vessel, as President Ezra Taft Benson put it. Pure in Heart is a clear, forthright book that offers authoritative penetrating commentary on this prerequisite to eternal life and helpful guidelines on how to attain it.", "genre": ["Religion", "Lds", "Nonfiction", "Church", "Spirituality", "Inspirational", "Christian"], "author": "Dallin H.

In her opening chapter on Marx, Kofman provides a reading of inversion as necessary to the ideological process. She then explores the metaphor of the camera obscura in Freud's description of the unconscious. For Nietzsche the camera obscura is a metaphor for forgetting. Kofman asks here whether the magical apparatus of the camera obscura, rather than bringing about clarity, serves some thinkers as fetish.

In his new translation, the first in English of the complete text, William Granger Ryan captures the immediacy of this rich, image-filled work, and offers an important guide for readers interested in medieval art and literature and, more generally, in popular religious culture.These stories have the effect of bringing the saints to life as real people, in the context of late thirteenth-century living, but in them the saints do things that ordinary people can only wonder at. There is St. Juliana, who, fed up with the propositions of a dull-witted demon, gives him a sound thrashing and tosses him in the sewer; St. Hilary, who challenges the authority of a corrupt pope and foresees the prelate's death; and St. James the Dismembered, who, with the chopping off of each body part by the Roman executioner, joyfully proclaims yet another reason for loving God.In the course of reading these stories, which are arranged according to the order of saints' feast days throughout the liturgical year, we happen upon many fascinating cultural and historical topics, such as the Christianization of Roman holidays, the symbolism behind the monk's tonsure, Nero's pregnancy, and the reason why chaste but hot-blooded women can grow beards. At the same time these stories draw abundantly on Holy Scripture to shed light on the mysteries of the Christian faith. The chapters devoted to Christ and to the Blessed Virgin are particularly moving examples of the mingling of doctrine and narrative to give life to dogma.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Art", "Classics", "Christianity", "Catholic", "Historical", "Medieval", "Religion", "Theology"], "author": "Jacobus de Voragine", "rating": "4.11", "pages": "416"}, {"id": 1256351, "title": "Runaway Ralph", "blurb": "Ralph is the only mouse living at the Mountain View Inn who owns a motorcycle--which means he has the perfect opportunity to explore the mysterious summer camp nearby.

After her husband's job offer falls through, Maddie signs on as a teacher at the Santangelo Academy, a boarding school for disturbed teenagers. Behind the academy's ornate gates, she discovers a disturbing realm where students and teachers alike must submit to the founder's bizarre therapeutic regimen. From day one, Maddie feels uneasy about smooth-talking Dr. Santangelo but when she questions his methods, she's appalled to find that her fellow teachers would rather turn on each other than stand up for themselves, much less protect the students in their care. A chilling event confirms Maddie's worst suspicions, then hints at an even darker secret history, one that twines through the academy's very heart. Cut off from the outside world, Maddie must join forces with a small band of the school's most violently rebellious students-kids whose troubled grip on reality may well prove to be her only chance of salvation.\n...more", "genre": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Suspense", "Thriller", "Mystery Thriller", "Thriller", "Adult Fiction", "Audiobook", "Young Adult", "Adult", "Contemporary"], "author": "Cornelia Read", "rating": "3.33", "pages": "326"}, {"id": 1256586, "title": "Anil's Ghost", "blurb": "With his first novel since the internationally acclaimed The English Patient, Booker Prize\u2014winning author Michael Ondaatje gives us a work displaying all the richness of imagery and language and the piercing emotional truth that we have come to know as the hallmarks of his writing.Anil\u2019s Ghost transports us to Sri Lanka, a country steeped in centuries of tradition, now forced into the late twentieth century by the ravages of civil war.

Reich is an obsessed monster, haunted by nightmares of a Man With No Face, driven and compelled to murder a rival magnate in a future where crime can't be hidden from police telepaths. The penalty is Demolition: erasure of the criminal's mind. Armed with an ugly weapon holding very special ammo, an insane jingle to mask his thoughts, and the resources of his interplanetary business empire, Reich takes on the world--but, as hinted by clues in chapter 1, he still doesn't understand his own buried motives. It's an impossible problem for police chief Lincoln Powell, one of the hated mind-reading elite--who knows very well whodunnit but can't go to court on telepathic evidence alone. Bester's dazzling 24th century is full of brilliant and dotty conceits, most famously the woven typographic patterns of telepaths' group 'conversations'. A gripping, headlong storyline hurtles from Earth's decadent high society to its lowest dives, with an interlude of mayhem at the Spaceland asteroid resort.

But at the center of the friendship is Quinn. A man who has scaled heights of success in business, Quinn is now adrift, waiting as builders put the finishing touches on his newest passion, a 180-foot yacht he plans to sail around the world.

It suggests that the state itself is becoming a vehicle for organized criminal activity. The authors propose criteria for gauging the criminalization of African states and present a novel prognosis: they distinguish between the corruption of previous decades and the criminalization of some African states now taking place. Major operators are now able to connect with global criminal networks. Also, the notion of social capital has led to current attitudestowards the use of public office for personal enrichment, or even systematic illegality. Looking at South Africa, the authors examine the decades-long tradition of association between crime and politics in this area. South Africa is now the centre of important international patterns of crime, notably in the drug trade. It has Africa's largest formal economy and the continent's largest criminal economy. Considering the economic origins of official implication in crime, the authors conclude that new forms of corruption have been unintentionally helped by liberal economic reforms.

Pope Joan was not betrayed by a lover or discovered by an enemy; her downfall came when she went into labor during a papal procession through the streets of Rome. From the myth of Joan to the experiences of saints, nuns, and ordinary women, The Oldest Vocation brings to life both the richness and the troubling contradictions of Christian motherhood in medieval Europe.After tracing the roots of medieval ideologies of motherhood in early Christianity, Clarissa W. Atkinson reconstructs the physiological assumptions underlying medieval notions about women's bodies and reproduction; inherited from Greek science and popularized through the practice of midwifery, these assumptions helped shape common beliefs about what mothers were. She then describes the development of spiritual motherhood both as a concept emerging out of monastic ideologies in the early Middle Ages and as a reality in the lives of certain remarkable women. Atkinson explores the theological dimensions of medieval motherhood by discussing the cult of the Virgin Mary in twelfth-century art, story, and religious expression. She also offers a fascinating new perspective on the women saints of the later Middle Ages, many of whom were mothers; their lives and cults forged new relationships between maternity and holiness. The Oldest Vocation concludes where most histories of motherhood begin-in early modern Europe, when the family was institutionalized as a center of religious and social organization.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Christian", "Historical", "Medieval"], "author": "Clarissa W.

Religious use of the bells was forbidden by law, but the villagers boldly insisted on their right to celebrate with peals the feast of a beloved saint. So begins Village Bells,  Alain Corbin's exploration of the auditory landscape of nineteenth-century France, a story of lost sensory experiences and forgotten passions. In the nineteenth century, these instruments were symbols of their towns and objects of both ecclesiastic and civic pride. Bell-ringing served practical purposes of communication, marking both religious and secular time, as well as calling citizens to pray, assemble, take arms, or beware of danger. As Corbin shows, the bells also reflected the social, political, and religious struggles of the time. To control the bells was to control the symbolic order, rhythm, and loyalties of French village and country life.Using church archives and local documents, Corbin forges a unique history of the role of bells from the aftermath of the Revolution to the dawn of the twentieth century. He charts how the First Republic (1792-1804) moved toward a more secular society, turning many bells into coins and cannonballs and seizing others as property of the state. A gradual return to the religious use of bells occurred in the nineteenth century, even as their new secular roles were maintained. Corbin describes the battles over the marking of religious versus secular time, as calls to prayer, the celebration of religious feasts, and the marking of rites of passage--baptism, marriage, and death--competed with tolls indicating the passing hours or marking assemblies, elections, or republican holidays.Thoroughly documented and recounted with intriguing narratives, Village Bells provides an original approach to nineteenth-century French cultural, social, and political history. As Corbin notes, the bells are no longer essential to our lives--their qualitative, sacred time and space replaced by the quantitative, secular measures of the clock--but by understanding their lost symbolic and practical importance we open a window onto the age in which they rang.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Cultural", "France", "Nonfiction", "Music"], "author": "Alain Corbin", "rating": "3.96", "pages": "416"}, {"id": 1261524, "title": "Pesthauch und Bl\u00fctenduft.

This is the story of schizophrenia, and the terrible things that it does to people. -Mary Loudon A multi-faceted and extraordinarily honest look at the devastating toll that schizophrenia takes on its victims and on those who care about them, Mary Loudon's Relative Stranger is riveting, illuminating, and heart-wrenching. It is the author's fascinating quest to find her sister Catherine, who was lost to her family long before she died, in Catherine's home, in her last hospital room, her paintings, her letters, her clothes. But perhaps even more compelling is Mary Loudon's internal journey. In facing the truths about Catherine's life and death, she asks hard questions about sanity, about family responsibility, about love, and about what it means to say that a life is - or is not - worth living. With intelligence, compassion, and a sharp eye for the funny as well as the sad, Mary Loudon ensures that we question everything we thought we knew about what it means to love, to lose, to live and die, and, most of all, to belong. My sister, Catherine, was a paranoid schizophrenic. Her illness was in place at birth and apparent during her childhood. During her teenage years, it asserted itself suddenly and aggressively. By the time she was in her mid-twenties, it had destroyed her chances of living anything approaching a normal life. . . . Following a severe breakdown, she first went missing, abroad, when she was nineteen and I was five. She was first sectioned when I was six, first sent to prison when I was seven. . . . She last wrote to me a year before her death from cancer, when she was forty-six and Iwas thirty-two. After Catherine died, I went to the Bristol Royal Infirmary, to see her body, and the hospital room where she had died. It was only there and then that I discovered one of many extraordinary things about my sister.

In the first book of her bestselling autobiographical series, she describes her traumatic childhood in the small, segregated town of Stamps, Arkansas, during the 1930s. Gather Together in My Name picks up the story in the postwar years, when Maya, a single teenager with an infant son becomes, in short order, a cook, a madam, a dancer, and a prostitute. Next comes Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, an account of her twenties and her unsuccessful first marriage to a white man. The Heart of a Woman, the fourth in the series, takes us through one of the most exciting and formative periods of Angelou's amazing life: her beginnings as a writer and an activist in New York.  Angelou has a happy knack of attracting the best and the brightest into her orbit, and The Heart of a Woman offers a veritable cornucopia of black luminaries in its pages. Singer Billie Holiday, writers John Ellins and Paule Marshall, jazz musicians Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln, and actors Godfrey Cambridge and James Earl Jones--Maya meets and learns from them all. Political activism soon follows as Ms. Angelou first organizes a theatrical benefit for the Reverend Martin Luther King and then becomes the director of the New York Southern Christian Leadership Conference office. Her involvement in the civil rights movement eventually brings her into contact with African freedom fighters Oliver Tambo and the charming Vusumzi Make, whom she marries and follows to Africa.

But Dad also passed on an important piece of advice that's especially relevant when Mickey takes the case of a wealthy Los Angeles realtor accused of attempted murder: The scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you [screw] up and he goes to prison, it'll scar you for life.Louis Roulet, Mickey's franchise client (so-called becaue he's able and willing to pay whatever his defense costs) seems to be the one his father warned him against, as well as being a few rungs higher on the socio-economic ladder than the drug dealers, homeboys, and motorcycle thugs who comprise Mickey's regular case load. But as the holes in Roulet's story tear Mickey's theory of the case to shreds, his thoughts turn more to Jesus Menendez, a former client convicted of a similar crime who's now languishing in San Quentin. Connelly tellingly delineates the code of legal ethics Mickey lives by: It didn't matter...whether the defendant 'did it' or not. What mattered was the evidence against him--the proof--and if and how it could be neutralized. My job was to bury the proof, to color the proof a shade of gray. Gray was the color of reasonable doubt. But by the time his client goes to trial, Mickey's feeling a few very reasonable doubts of his own.While Mickey's courtroom pyrotechnics dazzle, his behind-the-scenes machinations and manipulations are even more incendiary in this taut, gripping novel, which showcases all of Connelly's literary gifts.

Masco examines how diverse groups--weapons scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, neighboring Pueblo Indian Nations and Nuevomexicano communities, and antinuclear activists--have engaged the U.S. nuclear weapons project in the post-Cold War period, mobilizing to debate and redefine what constitutes national security.In a pathbreaking ethnographic analysis, Masco argues that the U.S. focus on potential nuclear apocalypse during the Cold War obscured the broader effects of the nuclear complex on American society. The atomic bomb, he demonstrates, is not just the engine of American technoscientific modernity; it has produced a new cognitive orientation toward everyday life, provoking cross-cultural experiences of what Masco calls a nuclear uncanny. Revealing how the bomb has reconfigured concepts of time, nature, race, and citizenship, the book provides new theoretical perspectives on the origin and logic of U.S. national security culture.

After six years living away, he's back in his old haunt, New York, where it seems his very unwelcome past is ready to resurface. Enter Dorothy Wynant, daughter of weird (and possibly insane) inventor Clyde Wynant. Wynant's secretary/mistress has just been murdered. Despite Nick's constant assertions that he's not in the business anymore and definitely not on the case, he gets drawn into a complicated web of family matters, confused identities, and surprising evidence. Wife Nora is a willing accomplice as they sift through the players in the mystery, all the while sipping cocktails and socializing in rarefied New York society. Despite his reluctance, he and Nora are drawn into a byzantine world of speakeasies, sociopaths, and shady ladies.

She refuses to set her beloved husband free to marry the queen; but she cannot prevent him from becoming the favorite and the focus of the feverishly plotting, pleasure seeking court.Others too oppose the marriage, but for very different reasons. William Cecil, the queen's wisest counselor, knows she must marry for policy; her uncle hates Dudley and swears he will be murder him first.

With stunning honesty and a lively, sly humor, Rae Yang records her life from her early years as the daughter of Chinese diplomats in Switzerland, to her girlhood at an elite middle school in Beijing, to her adolescent experience as a Red Guard and later as a laborer on a pig farm in the remote northern wilderness. She tells of her eventual disillusionment with the Maoist revolution, how remorse and despair drove her almost to suicide, and how she struggled to make sense of conflicting events that often blurred the line between victim and victimizer, aristocrat and peasant, communist and counterrevolutionary. Moving gracefully between past and present, dream and reality, the author artfully conveys the vast complexity of life in China as well as the richness, confusion, and magic of her own inner life and struggle.Much of the power of the narrative derives from Yang's multi-generational, cross-class perspective. She invokes the myths, legends, folklore, and local customs that surrounded her and brings to life the many people who were instrumental in her life: her nanny, a poor woman who raised her from a baby and whose character is conveyed through the bedtime tales she spins; her father; her beloved grandmother, who died as a result of the political persecution she suffered.Spanning the years from 1950 to 1980, Rae Yang's story is evocative, complex, and told with striking candor.

Protestants, Buddhists, Daoists, practitioners of folk religions, even intellectuals seeking more secularized answers to ultimate concerns are engaged in spiritual quests. Madsen is interested in determining if such quests contain the resources for constructing a more humane political order in China. Will religion contribute to or impede economic modernization? What role will the church play in the pluralization of society?

Beansie (so nicknamed because he had stolen a crate of beans as a child) had spent the better part of that day in the Majestic Tavern, a dive bar on the ground floor of the Stapinskis\u00ed apartment building. As the afternoon wore on, Beansie's usual ranting turned mean. He flashed a loaded gun; a silver .22 glowing in the light from the Yankee game on the tavern TV, and bragged to his drinking buddies that he had a bullet for each of his relatives living above the Majestic. But news traveled fast in the neighborhood, and before Beansie, a convicted murderer and armed robber, could stumble upstairs, the cops had him in handcuffs. The headline in the local newspaper the next day read Man Seized On Way To Kill 5 Children. As Stapinski writes, Jersey City was a tough place to grow up, except I didn't know any better.In this unforgettable memoir, Stapinski tells the heartbreaking yet often hilarious story of growing up among swindlers, bookies, and crooks. With deadpan humor and obvious affection, she comes clean with the outrageous tales that have swirled around her relatives for decades, and recounts the epic drama and comedy of living in a household in which petty crime was a way of life. The dinner Helene's mother put on the table (often prime rib, lobster tail, and fancy cakes) was usually swiped from the cold-storage company where Helene's father worked. The soap and toothpaste in the bathroom were lifted from the local Colgate factory. The books on the family's shelves were smuggled out of a book-binding company in Aunt Mary Ann's oversize girdle (or taken by Grandpa Beansie from the Free Public Library). Uncle Henry did a booming business as the neighborhood bookie, cousins did jail time, and Great-Aunt Katie, who liked to take a shot of whiskey each morning to clear her lungs, was a ward leader in the notorious Jersey City political machine.No backdrop could be more appropriate for the Stapinskis than Jersey City; a place known for its ties to the Mafia, industrial blight, and corrupt local officials, and the author ingeniously weaves the checkered history of her hometown throughout the book. Navigating a childhood of toxic waste and tough love, Stapinski tells an extraordinary tale that, unlike the swag of her childhood, is her very own.", "genre": ["Memoir", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "Biography Memoir", "History", "True Crime", "Autobiography"], "author": "Helene Stapinski", "rating": "3.59", "pages": "272"}, {"id": 1264555, "title": "Nightwing: Love and War", "blurb": "In this volume collecting issues #125-132, Nightwing faces off against Raptor, a powerful new foe wanted by the police for murder.

Immediately, we learn that something perhaps even more serious has taken place; we are in a maelstrom of startling events....Candy Marshall, the headstrong young white owner of the plantation (it's been in her family for generations) tells everyone in sight that she shot Beau, imploring them to believe her, though she knows from the start that no one will. And before she calls the sheriff, Candy has gathered more than a dozen aging black men with just-fired shotguns\u2014which most of them seem barely able to carry, much less aim and shoot\u2014each in his turn claiming that he shot Beau. Mapes, the old-line country sheriff, finds that even physical force\u2014in the past, a foolproof method of persuasion and coercion\u2014cannot break down the circle of protection that has suddenly been thrown up around the real murderer. And he realizes too that not only are these men unafraid of an act of vengeance by the Boutan family, but they are waiting for it, welcoming a chance for their own revenge after whole lifetimes of oppression.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Classics", "Cultural", "African American", "Academic", "School", "American", "Southern", "Literature", "Race", "Literary Fiction", "Historical"], "author": "Ernest J.
