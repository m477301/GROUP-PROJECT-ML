W\u00e4hrend Pr\u00e4sident Bush immer noch die Waltons als die ideale Fernsehfamilie pries und man sich hier zu Lande an den Wicherts und Beimerts orientieren musste, demontierten die Simpsons die Vorstellungen der intakten Kernfamilie mit satirischem Witz.

Now, the popular comedian delivers It's What He Would've Wanted, a brutally funny, highly charged, and moving novel about a directionless thirty-year-old man's belated transition into adulthood.  Our narrator and protagonist is Shea Hickson, a commitment-phobic just-turned-thirty-year-old with somewhat adolescent leanings. Shea lives off lottery winnings and spends his time blindly serving a secret organization whose stated duty is to seek truth, which, though Shea doesn't quite realize it, turns out to be a small-time terrorist gig. Shea's parents appear to be a quintessentially comfortable, suburban middle-class couple, and when sons Shea and Orwell (named after Che Guevara and George, their father having been something of a nostalgic radical) arrive for Christmas Eve, all seems as it should be. But when Shea turns a corner to find his father, a BBC weatherman, hanging from the light fixture, the son's disaffected existence is turned upside down. Worse, Shea's discovery of an encoded journal his father had been keeping uncovers shocking revelations about his father's disappointed life as a parent, husband, and disillusioned minor celebrity.

This is, she writes, the ultimate debate of moral entitlement. She explains the premise of suicide and how it pivots on a fatal logical flaw.  Presenting an eloquent case against our understanding of depression and bereavement, she poses a profound question:  If death is a process and not a state, how does that change the experience of grief?

He regarded Either/Or as the beginning of his authorship, although he had published two earlier works on Hans Christian Andersen and irony. The pseudonymous volumes of Either/Or are the writings of a young man (I) and of Judge William (II). The ironical young man's papers include a collection of sardonic aphorisms; essays on Mozart, modern drama, and boredom; and 'The Seducer's Diary.' The seeming miscellany is a reflective presentation of aspects of the 'either,' the esthetic view of life. Part II is an older friend's 'or,' the ethical life of integrated, authentic personhood, elaborated in discussions of personal becoming and of marriage. The resolution of the 'either/or' is left to the reader, for there is no Part III until the appearance of Stages on Life's Way.

Und dennoch wurde S\u00f6ren Kierkegaard damit zum Wegbereiter der Existenzphilosophie. Vieles, was diese pr\u00e4gende Denkrichtung des 20. Jahrhunderts ausmacht, findet sich bereits bei ihm: Einsamkeit und Verzweiflung, die Geworfenheit des Menschen, das Absurde, die Angst als Urtatbestand des Menschseins; und da\u00df es eben nicht um abstrakte, allgemeine Fragen der Philosophie geht, sondern immer um die konkrete Lebenssituation und existentielle Not des Einzelnen. Die Reihe Philosophie f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger zeichnet sich besonders durch Autoren aus, die nicht nur kompetent und anschaulich schreiben k\u00f6nnen, sondern -- wie in diesem Fall Asa Schillinger-Kind -- dem Leser auch ihre eigene Begeisterung f\u00fcr das jeweilige Werk nahebringen. Zum Beispiel die Begeisterung f\u00fcr die unglaubliche Aktualit\u00e4t Kierkegaards, mit der er die Themen der modernen Existenz schon vor \u00fcber 150 Jahren verbl\u00fcffend genau auf den Punkt brachte. So erinnert die von ihm ausf\u00fchrlich geschilderte \u00e4sthetische Lebenshaltung an unsere heutige Spa\u00df- und Erlebniskultur, wo das Genie\u00dfen des Genusses zum eigentlichen Ziel wird, am Ende aber doch nur ein schales Gef\u00fchl der Leere steht.

In the title story, a beautiful (and married) rich woman has taken up with a distinguished poet--and Father Brown, rather than reacting as expected, appears to be providing assistance. Also includes The Quick One, The Blast of the Book, The Green Man, The Pursuit of Mr Blue, The Crime of the Communist, The Point of a Pin, The Insoluble Problem, and The Vampire of the Village.

A cancer patient herself when she was writing the book, Sontag shows how the metaphors and myths surrounding certain illnesses, especially cancer, add greatly to the suffering of patients and often inhibit them from seeking proper treatment. By demystifying the fantasies surrounding cancer, Sontag shows cancer for what it is - just a disease. Cancer, she argues, is not a curse, not a punishment, certainly not an embarrassment and, it is highly curable, if good treatment is followed. Almost a decade later, with the outbreak of a new, stigmatized disease replete with mystifications and punitive metaphors, Sontag wrote a sequel to Illness as Metaphor, extending the argument of the earlier book to the AIDS pandemic.These two essays now published together, Illness as Metaphor and AIDS and Its Metaphors, have been translated into many languages and continue to have an enormous influence on the thinking of medical professionals and, above all, on the lives of many thousands of patients and caregivers.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Writing", "Essays", "Philosophy", "Health", "Medicine", "Health", "Philosophy", "Theory", "Psychology", "Disability", "Science", "Medical"], "author": "Susan Sontag", "rating": "3.95", "pages": "87"}, {"id": 1601957, "title": "Byzantium and the Crusader States 1096-1204", "blurb": "This is the first scholarly history of the relations between Byzantium and the Crusader States of Syria and Palestine.

Dust and distance become constant companions . . . punctuated by moments of such intense and arresting beauty that all else, poverty, heat and sickness, are forgotten.Written in the 1970s, Into India achieved classic status and remained in print for twenty years.

An Introduction distinguishes myth from legend, with which it is usually confused, and offers a system of classification of myths, which follows the arrangement of mythological motifs in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk Literature. The myths in this collection are arranged according to the eight categories in the system of classification mentioned above: 1) the Gods: their Activities and Relationships; 2) Cosmology and Cosmogony; 3) Topographical Features of the Earth (water and land features); 4) World Calamities (The Great Flood); 5) Establishment of the Natural Order; 6) Creation and Ordering of Human Life; 7) Origin of Animal Life and Characteristics; and 8) Origin of Plant Life and Characteristics. Within each category, the myths are arranged by region -- Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao. Exceptions were made in the myths on the origin of animals and plants, which are arranged alphabetically. As with the other volumes in the series, the selections are given in English translation, in order to make them accessible to an international readership.

She was the most admired woman in the country and established a style of entertaining never before seen in the White House. And only she could get away with beating the Prince of Wales at bowling! Her life was marked by tragedy, yet she lived every day to the fullest. Her legacy lives on in Baltimore and Washington through a pediatric hospital, a school for boys, a museum of art, and a monument to James Buchanan. Thanks to her beauty, charm, and generosity of spirit, America's First Lady will always be Harriet Lane.\n...more", "genre": ["Biography", "History"], "author": "Milton Stern", "rating": "3.32", "pages": "224"}, {"id": 1609592, "title": "The Collectors", "blurb": "People are dropping dead in Washington, D.C., and the Camel Club must unravel a secret that threatens to bring America to its knees.

Blocher classifies the principal approaches and solutions that have been hammered out, and he sympathetically explains the proposals and most of their typical representatives. But when he holds them up to the light of facts, reason and Scripture, Blocher finds none of these solutions adequate.Evil-that horrific, unjustifiable reality, is at bottom a dark and inscrutable enigma, a parasite of truth. Blocher finds the only satisfying response in the cross of Jesus Christ. There the offense of evil is in no way diminished by plausible argument.

That it does so with grace, power, and amazing courage, is obvious with every word encountered, every step around the parameters of what is possible--Charles Alexander.

Nagami is listening for all the elements in the language. What strikes me as a reader is the degree to which these texts remain true to their source materials while demonstrating a total commitment to the traditional effects of poetry--concision, a foregrounding of the formal elements of poetry, even a goofball elegance that has much to do with the New York School's commitment to wit.

Feminist scholarship employs gender as a fundamental organizing category of human experience, holding two related premises: men and women have different perceptions or experiences in the same contexts, the male perspective having been dominant in fields of knowledge; and that gender is not a natural fact but a social construct, a subject to study in any humanistic discipline.

The ensuing years saw Germans keen to close this parenthesis and begin rebuilding society, as contemporary-history scholar Pierre Ay\u00e7oberry puts it, but they had to reconcile their role in a regime responsible for unprecedented atrocities, in near-full collusion with both industry and the church. Ay\u00e7oberry cites a broad range of postwar intellectual and political positions, denunciations and apologias relating to the Prussian tradition ... alternated with diagnoses of the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic, suggestions for the rejuvenation of conservatism and liberalism, and attempts to answer the piercing question, 'Are we Germans different from other peoples?' Ay\u00e7oberry, the respected author of The Nazi Question, revisits this self-examination with an objective outsider's eye and an exceptional facility with German history. Systematically cataloguing the significant events, individuals, and organizations in Germany from 1933 to 1945, Ay\u00e7oberry sorts out the period's difficult questions, shining light on and giving explanation for the many who threw in with the F\u00fchrer and recounting the penalties paid by those who didn't.

If touch is the sense that mediates between the body of the subject and the world, these essays make apparent the frequently disregarded lexicons of tactility that lie behind and beneath early modern discursive constructions of eroticism, knowledge, and art. For the early moderns, touch was the earliest and most fundamental sense. Frequently aligned with bodily pleasure and sensuality, it was suspect; at the same time, it was associated with the authoritative disciplines of science and medicine, and even with religious knowledge and artistic creativity.The unifying impulse of Sensible Flesh is both analytic and recuperative. It attempts to chart the important history of the sense of touch at a pivotal juncture and to understand how tactility has organized knowledge and defined human subjectivity. The contributors examine in theoretically sophisticated ways both the history of the hierarchical ordering of the senses and the philosophical and cultural consequences that derive from it.The essays consider such topics as New World contact, the eroticism of Renaissance architecture, the Enclosure Acts in England, plague, the clitoris and anatomical authority, Pygmalion, and the language of tactility in early modern theater. In exploring the often repudiated or forgotten sense of touch, the essays insistently reveal both the world of sensation that subtends early modern culture and the corporeal foundations of language and subjectivity.", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Elizabeth D.

Questions of identity, policy, and exchange make it difficult to determine the place of art, and often the art itself results from these conflicts of geography and culture. Addressing an important approach to art history, Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann's book offers essays that focus on the intricacies of accounting for the geographical dimension of art history during the early modern period in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.Toward a Geography of Art presents a historical overview of these complexities, debates contemporary concerns, and completes its exploration with a diverse collection of case studies.

But while both Americans and Japanese believe that nurturing a young person's ability to use his or her will is crucial, they take very different approaches to dealing with expressions of will. LeTendre also finds conflicting expectations and theories about adolescent development within each system, and he investigates how these can lead to confusion and contradictory rules.

It is distributed to the book trade by Utah State University Press.The valleys, mountains, and deserts of Utah have been home to native peoples for thousands of years. Like peoples around the word, Utah's native inhabitants organized themselves in family units, groups, bands, clans, and tribes. Today, six Indian tribes in Utah are recognized as official entities. They include the Northwestern Shoshone, the Goshutes, the Paiutes, the Utes, the White Mesa or Southern Utes, and the Navajos (Dineh). Each tribe has its own government. Tribe members are citizens of Utah and the United States; however, lines of distinction both within the tribes and with the greater society at large have not always been clear. Migration, interaction, war, trade, intermarriage, common threats, and challenges have made relationships and affiliations more fluid than might be expected. In this volume, the editor and authors endeavor to write the history of Utah's first residents from an Indian perspective. An introductory chapter provides an overview of Utah's American Indians and a concluding chapter summarizes the issues and concerns of contemporary Indians and their leaders. Chapters on each of the six tribes look at origin stories, religion, politics, education, folkways, family life, social activities, economic issues, and important events. They provide an introduction to the rich heritage of Utah's native peoples. This book includes chapters by David Begay, Dennis Defa, Clifford Duncan, Ronald Holt, Nancy Maryboy, Robert McPherson, Mae Parry, Gary Tom, and Mary Jane Yazzie.Forrest Cuch was born and raised on the Uintah and Ouray Ute Indian Reservation in northeastern Utah. He graduated from Westminster College in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree in behavioral sciences. He served as education director for the Ute Indian Tribe from 1973 to 1988. From 1988 to 1994 he was employed by the Wampanoag Tribe in Gay Head, Massachusetts, first as a planner and then as tribal administrator.

Although his name is not well known today, Alexander's musical legacy is vast. His 1962 song You Better Move On was the first hit to emerge from the fedgling Muscle Shoals FAME studio in Alabama, and his fusion of country and soul and his heartfelt vocals on such songs as Anna (Go to Him) and Every Day I Have to Cry were revered by musicians including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan, all of whom recorded his songs.Alexander's story is a tragic one, with a brief, redemptive finale. His meteoric rise after the release of You Better Move On gave way to lean years caused both by his drug and alcohol abuse and by the mishandling of his career by producers and managers. In 1977, he quit the music business, but his music lived on. In 1992, Alexander returned tothe studio and recorded the critically praised album Lonely Just Like Me. Just three months after the album's release in March 1993, he suffered a heart attack in the offices of his music publisher in Nashville and died three days later.In telling Alexander's story, Richard Younger captures the burgeoning music scenes in Muscle Shoals and Nashville during the 1960s and 1970s and recovers the life of a fascinating musician whose influence was international. Younger's account is enriched by his interviews with more than 200 artists, family members, and friends--such as Rick Hall, Billy Sherrill, Charlie McCoy, Chuck Jackson, Gerry Marsden, and Kris Kristofferson--and includes an abundance of never-before-seen photographs.\n...more", "genre": ["Music", "Biography", "History"], "author": "Richard Younger", "rating": "4.09", "pages": "248"}, {"id": 1614529, "title": "Poison Tree: A True Story of a Family Terror: A True Story of Family Terror", "blurb": "Prendergast, who for Rolling Stone covered the trials of teenagers Richard and Deborah Jahnke in Wyoming for the 1982 murder of their father, has produced an objective, affecting account of the case.

A borderline psychotic, Jahnke senior subjected his wife and children to abuse both physical and psychological and, for a time, made sexual advances toward his daughter. Their residence became a house of terror, with the mother the most terrified of all, according to Prendergast. The children's feeble and intermittent attempts to acquaint outsiders with their situation were of no avail. Finally, with his sister's semiconnivance, Richard shot his father. The trials of the two, held separately, showed American justice at its worst: a prosecutor more interested in convictions than in finding the truth, and two inept and hidebound judges, one of whom would not admit evidence of child abuse.

That box held one year I'd spent a lifetime trying to forget.Summer in Job's Corner meant big trees, cool grass, and sweltering afternoons stretching endlessly under the Southern sun. Those were the days without plastic, microwaves, television, or air conditioning, a time when clocks ticked comfortingly in the night and a cool breeze was a gift. But as the long sultry summer of 1949 comes to an end, events will transform this sleepy Southern crossroads.After losing her mother to polio, eleven-year-old Carley Marshall comes to Job's Corner to make a new start, along with her Aunt Kate and Uncle Stephen Whitfield and her cousins Abby and John. The family is welcomed warmly by this small North Carolina community as Stephen takes up the post of pastor to Bethel Church, a Presbyterian congregation. But their welcome begins to wear thin and covert criticism runs rampant as Stephen challenges age-old beliefs and traditions.As Job's Corner confronts national struggles for civil rights, coal strikes, and hysteria over Communism, Stephen's voice of reason gets lost in the growing hostility of a vocal minority. Though this quintessential Southern community seems to be filled with people who are the salt of the earth, secrets and lies are hidden beneath the easy-going surface--and the truth must be revealed before an innocent man is convicted of murder.With the dawning of a new decade, Carley learns to face her own family secrets.

Born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov in 1870, the son of a schools inspector and a doctor's daughter, Lenin was to become the greatest single force in the Soviet revolution--and perhaps the most influential politician of the twentieth century. Drawing on sources only recently discovered, Robert Service explores the social, cultural, and political catalysts for Lenin's explosion into global prominence. His book gives us the vast panorama of Russia in that awesome vortex of change from tsarism's collapse to the establishment of the communist one-party state. Through the prism of Lenin's career, Service focuses on dictatorship, the Marxist revolutionary dream, civil war, and interwar European politics. And we are shown how Lenin, despite the hardships he inflicted, was widely mourned upon his death in 1924.  Service's Lenin is a political colossus but also a believable human being. This biography stresses the importance of his supportive family and of its ethnic and cultural background. The author examines his education, upbringing, and the troubles of his early life to explain the emergence of a rebel whose devotion to destruction proved greater than his love for the proletariat he supposedly served.

Ranging from the picaresque to the satirical, Cervantes's Exemplary Stories defy the conventions of heroic chivalric literature through a combination of comic irony, moral ambiguity, realism, and sheer mirth. With acute narrative skill and deft characterisation, drawing on colloquial language and farce, Cervantes creates a tension between the everyday and the literary, the plausible and the improbable. While encouraging us to reach our own moral conclusions, he also persuades us to accept the coincidental and the incredible: two boys indulge their life of crime at a time of public prayer; a young nobleman undergoes a change of identity at the behest of not a princess but a mere gipsy girl, and, most fantastically, talking dogs philosophize in a ward full of syphilitics. By placing the extraordinary within the contexts of the ordinary, the Exemplary Stories chart new novelistic territory and demonstrate Cervantes at his most imaginative and innovative.

We see his wife, Enide, develop as an exemplar of chivalry in the female, not as an Amazon, but as a brave, resolute, and wise woman.

Many areas of the world, including regions of the United States, have experienced a wide range of unusually dramatic weather events recently. Much climate change analysis forecasts horrors of biblical proportions, such as massive floods, habitat loss, species loss, and epidemics related to warmer weather. Such accounts of impending disaster have helped trigger extreme reactions, wherein some observers simply dismiss global climate change as, at the very worst, a minor inconvenience requiring modest adaptation. It is perhaps no surprise, therefore, that an American federal government known for institutional gridlock has accomplished virtually nothing in this area in the last decade. Policy inertia is not the story of this book, however. Statehouse and Greenhouse examines the surprising evolution of state-level government policies on global climate change. Environmental policy analyst Barry Rabe details a diverse set of innovative cases, offering detailed analysis of state-level policies designed to combat global warming. The book explains why state innovation in global climate change has been relatively vigorous and why it has drawn so little attention thus far. Rabe draws larger potential lessons from this recent flurry of American experience. Statehouse and Greenhouse helps to move debate over global climate change from bombast to the realm of what is politically and technically feasible.\n...more", "genre": ["Environment"], "author": "Barry G.

In a precise, engaging, and authoritative manner, each volume combines a vivid portrait of the master musicians' inspirations, influences, life experiences, even their weaknesses, with an accessible discussion of their work-all in roughly 300 pages. Further, each volume offers superb reference material, including a detailed life and times chronology, a complete list of works, a personalia glossary highlighting the important people in the composer's life, and a select bibliography.

In this volume, Donald Burrows's relates Handel's life and his music, devoting particular attention to two crucial junctures in Handel's development: his transition from a church-trained musician in Germany to a successful opera composer in London, and the gradual transformation of his theater career from opera to oratorio, some thirty years later. In the oratorio form, as Burrows demonstrates, Handel was able to combine the techniques of large-scale construction and of aria writing that he had developed in his operas with an experience of choral music that went back to his earliest training as a church organist.

D. James als wirkliche Queen of crime, denn sie gibt jeder ihrer Figuren, sei es die Putzfrau oder der geschiedenen Mann des Opfers, eine eigene Geschichte. Was gut und b\u00f6se ist z\u00e4hlt mit Sicherheit zu den besten Thrillern des Fr\u00fchjahres 1999. --Manuela HaselbergerAmazon.comObwohl Was gut und b\u00f6se ist mit der Nachricht von einem Mord beginnt, findet das Opfer erst vier Wochen sp\u00e4ter seinen Tod. Venetia Aldridge wird in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit respektiert, insgeheim jedoch von vielen geha\u00dft und hat viel mehr Feinde als eine Londoner Anw\u00e4ltin f\u00fcr Strafsachen haben sollte -- und zumindest einer dieser Feinde ist fest entschlossen, sie ins Jenseits zu bef\u00f6rdern. Venetia geht ihrer Arbeit in h\u00f6heren Gerichten nach, die die Illusion erwecken, da\u00df menschliche Leidenschaften sich kontrollieren und b\u00e4ndigen lassen. Venetias Vergangenheit und ihr Privatleben sind allerdings ausgesprochen ungeordnet. Ihr verheirateter Liebhaber m\u00f6chte sie eher heute als morgen verlassen; von ihrer Tochter wird sie geha\u00dft; ihre Anwaltskollegen setzen alles daran, zu verhindern, da\u00df sie die n\u00e4chste Vorsitzende der Anwaltskammer wird. Sogar die Putzfrau scheint irgendein Problem mit ihr zu haben.Allein den Handlungsverlauf dieses komplexen Romans zu umrei\u00dfen w\u00fcrde Seiten f\u00fcllen (dasselbe gilt f\u00fcr eine eklektische Liste der handelnden Personen), aber bei P. D. James gibt es mehr zu bewundern als ihre brillant gestrickte Handlung. James gelingt es, eine ganze Galerie \u00fcberraschend anst\u00e4ndiger Verd\u00e4chtiger zu schaffen, und dazu einen passend finsteren Charakter zu erfinden -- bei dem es sich ausgerechnet um Aldridges letzten Klienten handelt.Was gut und b\u00f6se ist ist nicht nur ein erstklassiger Mordfall, sondern auch eine packende Darstellung wilder Justiz. James' Charaktere m\u00f6gen vom Ha\u00df \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigt werden, aber in gleicher Weise kommt bei James auch die Liebe zum Zug -- menschlich, g\u00f6ttlich, zerst\u00f6rerisch und heilend. Auf dem H\u00f6hepunkt ihres Schaffens (ihr Potential ist erstaunlich) hat P. D. James ihr bestes Buch seit Innocent Blood geschrieben. Die Ideen, die Energie und die Kunst, die sie in A Certain Justice zur Schau stellt, zeigen andere, j\u00fcngere Autoren vielleicht \u00fcber den Zeitraum ihrer gesamten Karriere. Mit \u00fcber 70 Jahren verweist James sie mit einem Buch mit offensichtlicher Leichtigkeit in die Schranken.Das Buch wird als An Adam Dalgliesh Novel ausgewiesen, aber in Was gut und b\u00f6se ist \u00fcberl\u00e4\u00dft der gr\u00fcblerische Dichter und Detektiv dem Mordopfer -- der wundervoll komplexen, eigentlich unsympathischen Rechtsanw\u00e4ltin Venetia Aldridge -- und der gleicherma\u00dfen faszinierenden Kate Miskin, seiner f\u00e4higen Assistentin, die B\u00fchne. Als Kate \u00fcber einen anderen jungen Polizeibeamten nachdenkt, vermutet sie, da\u00df er die Traditionen, die Konventionen der Polizeihierarchie, irgendwie l\u00e4cherlich, vielleicht sogar ein wenig albern fand. Sie sp\u00fcrte zudem, da\u00df das eine Ansicht war, die AD [Adam Dalgliesh] auf gewisse Weise verstehen konnte, auch wenn er sie nicht teilte. Aber sie konnte ihr Leben nicht so ausrichten, konnte nicht so leichtfertig sein, was ihre Karriere betraf... Was gut und b\u00f6se ist ist die perfekte Kriminalgeschichte, um neue Leser f\u00fcr die enthusiastische Fangemeinde von P. D. James zu gewinnen.

Although those familiar with the traditional Tarot will recognize many of the cards of the Minchiate, even Tarot aficionados will be surprised and delighted by many striking differences, such as the knights who are now transformed into mythical beasts or the Chariot card in which the armored warrior has been replaced by a peaceful maiden. Brian Williams's insightful interpretations of the cards, based on his extensive knowledge of the Tarot and Italian history, enable readers to use this deck as a tool for profound self-exploration and transformation. One of the most popular Italian Tarots, the Minchiate served as the basis for many other famous decks before fading into obscurity during the nineteenth century.

But before the darkness fell on New Year's Eve at the end of the year, the Wright brothers would be worldwide celebrities, heralded as the first people in all of human history to conquer the sky.It was the year Teddy Roosevelt sent the Great White Fleet on a voyage around the globe, Robert Peary began his courageous dash to the North Pole, six automobiles left Times Square on an epic twenty-thousand-mile race to Paris, and Henry Ford introduced an oddly shaped new automobile called the Model T.It was a time of seemingly boundless innovation - everything was bigger, better, fast, and greater than ever before. In New York and Chicago, banks of high-speed elevators zipped through vertical shafts in the tallest buildings on earth. Pneumatic tubes whisked mail between far-flung post offices in minutes. Women cleaned their homes with amazing new devices called vacuums. And as American engineers cut a fifty-mile canal through the Isthmus of Panama, the very air buzzed with the imagined potential of new technology, including a portable wireless telephone that would someday allow people to talk while they walked.Meanwhile, the New York Giants battled the Chicago Cubs in one of the most thrilling seasons in baseball history, and a reluctant William Howard Taft was elected twenty-seventh president of the United States.By turns gripping and humorous, shocking and delightful, Jim Rasenberger's America, 1908 brings to life our nation as it was one hundred years ago, at a moment of delirious optimism and pride, a time when Americans believed that even the most intractable problems would soon be solved and that the future was bound to be better than the past.What will the year 2008 bring us? pondered the New York World on New Year's Day of 1908. What marvels of development await the youth of tomorrow? As Thomas Edison said later that year, Anything, everything, is possible.Shedding new light on stories we thought we knew and telling fresh stories we can't believe we've never heard, American, 1908 is a rousing chronicle of a country on the brink of greatness - and a timely, thought-provoking glimpse at a younger America, even as we wonder what awaits us in the century ahead.", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "American History", "Audiobook", "Science"], "author": "Jim Rasenberger", "rating": "3.85", "pages": "307"}, {"id": 1619811, "title": "Taste Of Home's Holiday & Celebrations Cookbook 2006", "blurb": "Contains recipes for Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, and special celebrations including Valentine's Day, Kentucky Derby.", "genre": ["Cookbooks"], "author": "Heidi Reuter Lloyd", "rating": "3.56", "pages": "256"}, {"id": 1619876, "title": "At Least We Were Married", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Terry C.

Building on the premise of Understanding by Design, their acclaimed framework for curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the authors present a compelling argument for using the same approach to reach a grand goal: the reform of schooling as a whole. In their view, reform rests on six pillars:* A relentless focus on the long-term mission of school: enabling learners to demonstrate understanding and mature habits of mind;* A curriculum and assessment framework that honors the mission and ensures that content coverage is no longer the accepted approach to instruction;* A set of principles of learning that support all decisions about pedagogy and planning;* Structures, policies, job descriptions, practices, and use of resources consistent with mission and learning principles;* An overall strategy that includes ongoing feedback and adjustment; and* A set of tactics linked to strategy, including a planning process that uses backward design to accomplish the key work of reform.Practical, insightful and provocative, Schooling by Design elaborates on each of these elements and presents educators with both the rationale and the methodology for closing the gap between what we say we want from school and what school actually delivers--for turning vision into reality.", "genre": ["Education", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Grant P.

The authors are process strategists, implementers and practitioners from various manufacturing and service companies, consulting firms, and universities, who wish to share their experiences and insights on the advantages of becoming a process-centered company and on the considerations that should be made in migrating from a functional to a process-focused organization. Functionally-focused organizations are often ineffective and inefficient when work must be coordinated across traditional functional boundaries. This is due to the fact that the needs of the customer are often secondary to the goals of each functional area, thereby creating functional silos and limiting the creation of value within the company. Worse still, the customer may be ignored and decide to go elsewhere. In contrast to a functional focus, a process-focused organization requires that every executive, manager and process performers constantly consider the needs of the customer in everything that is done. Boundaries between functions are torn down as the organization creates core processes that involve personnel, technology and information across numerous functions for the purpose of adding value to the goods and services that a company creates, thereby maximizing customer satisfaction. A process-focused approach enable organizations to attain a competitive advantage through the integration of otherwise disconnected initiatives. The Guide is organized into four sections: Section 1 - Creates the strategic vision for process management; clarifies the hierarchy and the concept of core process development; provides suggestions for introducing process management within the organization and addresses organizational and behavioral issues; and defines the roles and responsibilities of process owners, controllers and performers. Section 2 - Provides guidance on migrating from a functionally-focused to a process-focused organization using a 4-step program to assess, develop, implement and embed process management within an organization. Section 3 - Introduces the concepts of sustaining process management through analyzing current and future-state processes in relationship to customers and markets; develops activity and process metrics relating value, time, quality, flexibility and functionality to maintain customer focus; and provides guidance for using continuous process improvement in strategic, tactical and operational planning and performance. Section 4 - Conclusions and summary of the Guide. The book is intended for business publication readers with emphasis on companies of all sizes that are exploring, planning and implementing process management in their organizations.

Nell'ottobre del 1993, viene chiesto a Messori di condurre un'intervista televisiva con Giovanni Paolo II, in occasione dei suoi quindici anni di pontificato; sarebbe stata la prima intervista della storia ad un pontefice, per un'ora, di domande lasciate, per giunta, alla completa autonomia dell'intervistatore. Il Papa aveva gi\u00e0 dato la propria disponibilit\u00e0 al progetto, la cui regia sarebbe stata affidata a Pupi Avati e che sarebbe stato trasmesso dalla RAI e in seguito dalle maggiori emittenti televisive mondiali. A causa di una serie di impegni del Pontefice fu tuttavia impossibile realizzare il progetto. Giovanni Paolo II si era per\u00f2 interessato alle domande postegli dal giornalista e, nei mesi successivi al loro incontro, aveva risposto per iscritto: \u00abAnche se non c'\u00e8 stato modo di risponderle di persona - comunica il Papa a Messori -, ho tenuto sul tavolo le sue domande.

A. MacDevitt. Caesar's Commentaries are an outstanding account of extraordinary events by one of the most exceptional men in the history of the world. Julius Caesar himself was one of the most eminent writers of the age in which he lived. His commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are written with a purity, precision, and perspicuity, which command approbation. They are elegant without affectation, and beautiful without ornament. Of the two books which he composed on Analogy, and those under the title of Anti-Cato, scarcely any fragment is preserved; but we may be assured of the justness of the observations on language, which were made by an author so much distinguished by the excellence of his own compositions. His poem entitled The Journey, which was probably an entertaining narrative, is likewise totally lost. All of Caesar's works that remain intact are contained in this edition of his commentaries.It is to the honor of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic. His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister.Caesar deprecated a lingering death, and wished that his own might be sudden and speedy. And the day before he died, the conversation at supper, in the house of Marcus Lepidus, turning upon what was the most eligible way of dying, he gave his opinion in favor of a death that is sudden and unexpected.

In reality, both realism and liberalism and their main insights were largely invented by republicans writing about republics.The main ideas of realism and liberalism are but fragments of republican security theory, whose primary claim is that security entails the simultaneous avoidance of the extremes of anarchy and hierarchy, and that the size of the space within which this is necessary has expanded due to technological change.In Daniel Deudney's reading, there is one main security tradition and its fragmentary descendants.

Forensic blood-spatter analyst Dexter Morgan is a nice guy who enjoys his job, but what he'd rather be doing is killing people. In this follow-up to 2001's Darkly Dreaming Dexter, Dexter is kept from his games of slice the slasher (he kills only murderers and pedophiles) by a suspicious Sergeant Doakes. Luckily for listeners, Dexter still finds a way to engage in his grim specialty when a fiendish doctor comes to town and leaves his victims brutally butchered, yet alive and crippled. Landrum, who is also an accomplished songwriter, hits all the right notes in this superb audio production, flawlessly matching the sarcastic and sinister tones of the novel. At times lighthearted and good-natured, Landrum's first-person narration of Dexter truly makes the character come alive. His transitions between character voices are perfectly consistenthe handles cocky men, grizzled veterans, tough female cops and demure women with equal flair, including a wonderfully quirky and disturbing voice for the novel's villain. Dexter is the most darkly charming and compelling serial killer since Hannibal Lecter, and this production is a sure-fire candidate for audiobook of the year.

In SONY: THE PRIVATE LIFE, John Nathan, a preeminent expert on Japanese culture, dissects this fable, pulling the veil from one of the world's most successful and secretive corporations. He uncovers persuasive evidence that Sony's biggest triumphs, from color TV to CDs, and most calamitous failures, like the Betamax debacle and the vexed takeover of Columbia Pictures, stem from the web of intense relationships that have always characterized its top ranks. Nathan traces this emotional web as no other writer has or could, by drawing on his unmatched expertise in Japanese culture and his unique, unlimited access to Sony's inner sanctum. With a novelist's skill - honed by translating the works of Yukio Mishima and Kenzaburo Oe - Nathan etches incisive portraits of the company's famously enigmatic cofounder, Akio Morita; its patrician, autocratic CEO, Norio Ohga; and its edgy new leader, Nobuyuki Idei, who already has brought wrenching changes to Sony. Nathan's exploration of the Sony empire also reveals how it invented color TV as we know it and used bold marketing techniques to best the inferior yet dominant American competition; why Sony ignored the conventional wisdom of the time to enter a groundbreaking partnership with archrival Philips to perfect the CD; how Sony manages to prosper despite Japan's economic malaise; and what innovations and strategies it plans for the new century. With authority and wit, Nathan dispels the myths that surround Sony and crafts unparalleled corporate drama. Sony: The Private Life is at once an engrossing chronicle of astounding entrepreneurship and a poignant account of loyalty's consequences.\n...more", "genre": ["Business", "History", "Nonfiction", "Cultural", "Japan", "Biography"], "author": "John Nathan", "rating": "3.85", "pages": "368"}, {"id": 1624263, "title": "Around the World in Eighty Days", "blurb": "One night in the reform club, Phileas Fogg bets his companions that he can travel across the globe in just eighty days.

With the growth of the number of Latinos in the United States, there has never been a voting block with the potential to determine the outcome of so many elections, both nationally and locally.

The monumental effect Hispanics will have on all areas of American culture, especially politics, will be acutely felt as the 2004 presidential election heats up.Ramos argues that the political party that can correctly understand the wants and needs of Hispanics will triumph in most elections throughout the country, pushing forward that party's agenda and solidifying its hold on power.By outlining what political issues are important to them, Ramos underscores why America should care about bridging the gap of misunderstanding that exists between Latinos and non-Latinos, during this, the most divisive presidential election the country has witnessed in decades.\n...more", "genre": ["Politics", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Jorge Ramos", "rating": "3.91", "pages": "0"}, {"id": 1627211, "title": "Islands In The Sky: Science Fiction", "blurb": "The story of 'Islands in the Sky' centers around a young man, who, after brilliantly winning a space-related competition, requests a vacation on a space station as his prize.

It is intended to make issues involved in language understanding, such as speech, text, and discourse, accessible to the widest group possible -- not just specialists in linguistics or communication theorists -- but all scholars and researchers whose enterprises depend on having a useful model of how communicative agents understand utterances and expect their own utterances to be understood.Based on feedback from readers over the past seven years, explanations in every chapter have been improved and updated in this thoroughly revised version of the original text published in 1989. The most extensive revisions concern the relevance of technical notions of mutual and normal belief, and the futility of using the notion 'null context' to describe meaning. In addition, the discussion of implicature now includes an extended explication of Grice's Cooperative Principle which attempts to put it in the context of his theory of meaning and rationality, and to preclude misinterpretations which it has suffered over the past 20 years.

Venerated as rock's one true genius, Dylan is considered responsible for introducing a new range of topics and new lyrical complexity into popular music. Without Bob Dylan, rock critic Dave Marsh once claimed, there would be no popular music as we understand it today.  As such an exalted figure, Dylan has been the subject of countless books and intricate scholarship considering various dimensions of both the man and his music. This book places new emphasis on Dylan as a rock star. Whatever else Dylan is, he is a star - iconic, charismatic, legendary, enigmatic. No one else in popular music has maintained such star status for so long a period of time.  Showing how theories of stardom can help us understand both Bob Dylan and the history of rock music, Lee Marshall provides new insight into how Dylan's songs acquire meaning and affects his relationship with his fans, his critics and the recording industry. Marshall discusses Dylan's emergence as a star in the folk revival (the spokesman for a generation) and the formative role that Dylan plays in creating a new type of music - rock - and a new type of star. Bringing the book right up to date, he also sheds new light on how Dylan's later career has been shaped by his earlier star image and how Dylan repeatedly tried to throw off the limitations and responsibilities of his stardom.  The book concludes by considering the revival of Dylan over the past ten years and how Dylan's stardom has developed in a way that contains, but is not overshadowed by, his achievements in the

Emperor Napoleon I, was a military and political leader of France whose actions shaped European politics in the early 19th century. Born in Corsica and trained as an artillery officer in mainland France, Bonaparte rose to prominence under the First French Republic and led successful campaigns against the First and Second Coalitions arrayed against France. In 1799, he staged a coup d'\u00e9tat and installed himself as First Consul; five years later he crowned himself Emperor of the French. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, he turned the armies of the French Empire against every major European power and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories-epitomised in battles such as Austerlitz. He maintained France's sphere of influence by the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French client states. The French invasion of Russia in 1812 marked a turning point in Napoleon's fortunes. His Grande Arm\u00e9e was badly damaged in the campaign and never fully recovered. In 1813, the Sixth Coalition defeated his forces at Leipzig; the following year the Coalition invaded France, forced Napoleon to abdicate and exiled him to the island of Elba. Less than a year later, he escaped Elba and returned to power, but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon spent the last six years of his life under British supervision on the island of Saint Helena. An autopsy concluded he died of stomach cancer, though Sten Forshufvud and other scientists have since conjectured that he waspoisoned with arsenic. His campaigns are studied at military academies the world over, and he is regarded as one of history's great commanders. While considered a tyrant by his opponents, he is also remembered for the establishment of the Napoleonic code, which laid the administrative and judicial foundations for much of Western Europe.", "genre": ["France"], "author": "Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord", "rating": "3.82", "pages": "Nook"}, {"id": 1630358, "title": "\u76ee\u96a0\u3057\u306e\u56fd 7", "blurb": "A high school girl with the power to see glimpses of the future meets a boy who can see the past.

That's how surgeon Eli Calhoun thinks of resident Maggie Berman. And nothing, not even kinky sex with the submissives at the Club Rio Brava, can get his mind off locking lips with his workmate again. There's just one problem. Eli's a sexual Dominant looking for a submissive, and Maggie's the most in control woman he's ever met. Until the night he takes her home and shatters that control-in the bedroom, at least. Maggie's running scared. She's learned some hard lessons from her ex-Master. When the hunky surgeon makes a move on her, offering to make her wildest dreams come true, it's not just about the sex. Eli wants it all-and that includes her precious control. Switching Control Dr. Tom Latimer is into major kink. A respected member of San Antonio society, he needs a mate who can not only satisfy his Dominant sexual needs but also act as a life partner, submissive lover, companion and friend. He's about to throw up his hands in defeat and admit no such woman exists for him when his eye is caught by Selina Harrison at Club Rio Brava. Selina is a big, beautiful wannabe Domme with a pedigree as long as his own, a history of spousal abuse that killed her trust in men-and a secret taste for the sort of loving dominance Tom wants to give. But as Tom discovers, things are not always what they seem. The sexy doctor's pulling out all the stops to convince the Domme with the luscious curves and baby-soft skin that switching sides and submitting to him are worth risking her heart-and her trust.

Man-houng Lin shows how the disruption in the world's silver supply caused by the turmoil in Latin America and subsequent changes in global markets led to the massive outflow of silver from China and the crisis of the Qing empire. During the first stage of this dynastic crisis, traditional ideas favoring plural centers of power became more popular than they ever had been. As the crisis developed, however, statist ideas came to the fore. Even though the Qing survived with the resumption of the influx of Latin American silver, its status relative to Japan in the East Asian order slipped. The statist inclination, although moderated to a degree in the modern period, is still ascendant in China today. These changes--Qing China's near-collapse, the beginning of its eclipse by Japan in the East Asian order, and shifting notions of the proper relationship between state and market and between state and society--led to China upside down.", "genre": ["History", "China"], "author": "Man-houng Lin", "rating": "5.00", "pages": "362"}, {"id": 1631210, "title": "Eothen - Travel in the East", "blurb": "A solitary Western traveler in the Middle East in 1834, this is an extraordinary work of travel writing that is more about the author's internal journey than it is about monuments and museums, one that replicates the personal experience of travel and how it changes who we are.

In this important national bestseller, Chalmers Johnson thoroughly explores the new militarism that is transforming America and compelling us to pick up the burden of empire. Recalling the classic warnings against militarism--from George Washington's farewell address to Dwight Eisenhower's denunciation of the military-industrial complex--Johnson uncovers its roots deep in our past. Turning to the present, he maps America's expanding empire of military bases and the vast web of services that support them. He offers a vivid look at the new caste of professional militarists who have infiltrated multiple branches of government, who classify everything they do as secret, and for whom the manipulation of the military budget is of vital interest. Among Johnson's provocative conclusions is that American militarism is already putting an end to the age of globalization and bankrupting the United States, even as it creates the conditions for a new century of virulent blowback.

His reputation is both a product of his own time and of the modern age: the esteem in which he was held in Japan was ignited in the West as critics, art dealers, and collectors vied for his colorfully painted and inscribed work at the beginning of the twentieth century. Charles Lang Freer (1854-1919) was the world's principal collector of Kenzan wares, acquiring artifacts ranging from original pieces by Kenzan to late nineteenth-century forgeries. This range is presented here for the first time. The story of his collection uncovers the secret history of the complex relationships between makers and connoisseurs, between individual creativity and artisanal work, relationships that often operate across centuries. The Potter's Brush explores the appropriation of the Kenzan name, detailing two centuries of innovation and reproduction, and charting the evolution of what amounts to a designer brand of ceramics. Abundantly illustrated in full color, with a complete inventory of the Freer Collection, this radical survey offers new ways of looking at both the works themselves and the strategies whereby their status has been established in the art world.Author Biography: Richard L.

This new biography, the first by a professional jazz scholar and performer, presents a huge amount of never-before-published material, including interviews with Coltrane, photos, genealogical documents, and innovative musical analysis that offers a fresh view of Coltrane's genius.Compiled from scratch with the assistance of dozens of Coltrane's colleagues, friends, and family, John Coltrane: His Life and Music corrects numerous errors from previous biographies. The significant people in Coltrane's life were reinterviewed, yielding new insights; some were interviewed for the first time ever. The musical analysis, which is accessible to the nonspecialist, makes its own revelations--for example, that some of Coltrane's well-known pieces are based on previously unrecognized sources. The Appendix is the most detailed chronology of Coltrane's performing career ever compiled, listing scores of previously unknown performances from the 1940s and early 1950s.Coltrane has become a musical inspiration for thousands of fans and musicians and a personal inspiration to as many more.

However, it was not widely known or circulated until the 1893 edition.The novel consists largely of a series of letters written by its heroine, Emily Barlow, to her friend, Sylvia Carey. When Emily sails from England for India in June 1814 her ship is attacked by Moorish pirates and she is taken to the harem of Ali, dey of Algiers. Ali rapes her and subjects her to his will, awakening her sexual passions. Emily's debasement continues when Ali insists on anal sex, arousing the horror of her correspondent Sylvia, who expresses her indignation at Ali's behaviour, in a letter that the latter intercepts. Annoyed at her attitude, Ali arranges for Sylvia to be abducted and brought to the slave market of Algiers. After an elaborate charade in which Ali pretends to be a sympathetic Frenchman, bidding to save her from sexual slavery, and engaging her in a fake marriage, he deflowers her and awakens her sexuality, as he had done with Emily. Revealing his true identity Ali enjoys both girls together. This sexual idyll is eventually terminated when a new addition to harem objects to anal rape and cuts off the Dey's penis with a knife, and then commits suicide.[1] Seemingly unfazed by this, Ali has his lost members preserved in spirits of wine in glass vases which he presents to Emily and Sylvia, sending them back to England with these tokens of his affection.[2]The novel also incorporates interpolated stories concerning the erotic misadventures of three other girls abducted into the harem and enlarges on the fate of Emily's maid Eliza who, presented by Ali to Muzra, bey of Tunis, is bound, flogged and raped in turn.[3]The book was one of those condemned as obscene by Lord Chief Justice Campbell when Dugdale was prosecuted in 1857.[4]Via Wikipedia", "genre": ["Erotica", "Fiction", "Classics", "Romance"], "author": "Anonymous", "rating": "2.77", "pages": "288"}, {"id": 1634721, "title": "Amatory Experiences of the Lustful Turk", "blurb": "A Sizzling Classic of Victorian Erotica!

Published in 1946, the book reflects events leading up to & during the Stalin era. Orwell, a democratic socialist, & a member of the Independent Labour Party for many years, was a critic of Joseph Stalin, and was suspicious of Moscow-directed Stalinism after his experiences with the NKVD during the Spanish Civil War.Orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which are described in another one of his books, Homage to Catalonia. He intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals. For the preface of a Ukrainian edition he prepared in 1947, he described what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm: ...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, & that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.This Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book. It was printed to be distributed among the Soviet citizens of Ukraine who were some of the many millions of displaced persons thruout Europe at the end of WW2. The American occupation forces considered the edition to be propaganda printed on illegal presses, & handed 1,500 confiscated copies of Animal Farm over to the Soviet authorities. The politics in the book also affected Britain, with Orwell reporting that Ernest Bevin was terrified that it may cause embarrassment if published before the 1945 general election. In recent years, the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt & undemocratic government or organisation, only to eventually become corrupt & oppressive themselves as they succumb to the trappings of power & begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as Zimbabwe & the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose succeeding African-born rulers were accused of being as corrupt as, or worse than, the European colonists they supplanted. The book also clearly ponders whether a focus of power in one person is healthy for a society. The book leaves the ending slightly ambiguous in this regard. Perhaps the largest overriding theme in Animal Farm is the famous quote by Lord Acton, Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n...more", "genre": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Dystopia", "Fantasy", "Politics", "Literature", "Academic", "School", "Science Fiction", "Novels", "Academic", "Read For School"], "author": "George Orwell", "rating": "3.98", "pages": "140"}, {"id": 1635037, "title": "Dance Me a Story: Twelve Tales from the Classic Ballets", "blurb": "A beautiful guide....The richly detailed watercolor illustrations...evoke the mood and atmosphere of each ballet.\u0097Prima BallerinaJane Rosenberg's delightful retelling for children of the greatest ballets is now available again.

Determining that by age ten children's minds could be turned from play to politics, the regime inducted nearly all German juveniles between the ages of ten and eighteen into its state-run organization. The result was a potent tool for bending young minds and hearts to the will of Adolf Hitler.Baldur von Schirach headed a strict chain of command whose goal was to shift the adolescents' sense of obedience from home and school to the racially defined Volk and the Third Reich. Luring boys and girls into Hitler Youth ranks by offering them status, uniforms, and weekend hikes, the Nazis turned campgrounds into premilitary training sites, air guns into machine guns, sing-alongs into marching drills, instruction into indoctrination, and children into Nazis. A few resisted for personal or political reasons, but the overwhelming majority enlisted.Drawing on original reports, letters, diaries, and memoirs, Kater traces the history of the Hitler Youth, examining the means, degree, and impact of conversion, and the subsequent fate of young recruits. Millions of Hitler Youth joined the armed forces; thousands gleefully participated in the subjugation of foreign peoples and the obliteration of racial aliens. Although young, they committed crimes against humanity for which they cannot escape judgment.

Fairbank's masterwork, China: A New History is without parallel as a concise, comprehensive, and authoritative account of China and its people over four millennia. Bringing to bear sixty years of research, travel, and teaching, Fairbank weaves a richly detailed history that reaches from China's neolithic days to its troubled present. With a deft hand, he depicts a country ever-changing and yet constant in its effort to achieve a cohesive identity, an enormous and enormously complex nation perpetually balancing between the imperatives of force and the power of ideas. Here are the Chinese autocrats in their various times and guises, maintaining Confucian civility and order through--paradoxically--the perpetual threat of irrational imperial violence. Here is the intellectual class, revered for its wisdom and counsel and yet--as events from the Cultural Revolution to the massacre in Tiananmen Square demonstrate--eminently expendable. And here are China's farmers engaged in a never-ending, backbreaking attempt to tame their temperamental countryside only to face repeated famine as China's agrarian-based economy fails to develop. At the center of all stands the Chinese family, until recently the model for both obedience and tyranny in society at large. Fairbank traces the growth of a civilization that could embrace so many contradictions and disruptions and yet retain a strong sense of its identity. Following China's ambivalent relations with the West and with the forces of modernization, he identifies, even in thegreat leap forward signaled by the Communist Revolution, the assumptions that have informed Chinese society for thousands of years.

La inmensidad del mundo y la aparente imposibilidad de que un ser humano pueda tener una verdadera relaci\u00f3n con todas las personas entran en conflicto con este ideal. A partir de estas circunstancias eminentemente reconocibles, el narrador ampl\u00eda r\u00e1pidamente su punto de vista para considerar el mundo y sus multitudes antes de llegar a la sugerencia de que todo esto es insignificante frente al universo.Olaf Stapledon fue un escritor y fil\u00f3sofo brit\u00e1nico cuya primera ciencia ficci\u00f3n se public\u00f3 en 1930. Gran parte de sus escritos se refieren al concepto de verdadera comunidad y a su creencia de que la humanidad, tal y como existe actualmente, no tiene capacidad real para comprender la verdad. Esto le sit\u00faa muy lejos de la corriente de ciencia ficci\u00f3n pulp de su \u00e9poca.

This trip is financially successful, and Crusoe plans another, leaving his early profits in the care of a friendly widow. The second voyage does not prove as fortunate: the ship is seized by Moorish pirates, and Crusoe is enslaved to a potentate in the North African town of Sallee. While on a fishing expedition, he and a slave boy break free and sail down the African coast. A kindly Portuguese captain picks them up, buys the slave boy from Crusoe, and takes Crusoe to Brazil. In Brazil, Crusoe establishes himself as a plantation owner and soon becomes successful.

Rescued and taken to a nearby farmhouse, the bird's plight will irrevocably change the lives of her savior, Michael Somers, and the woman and child Somers comes to love. Somers has returned to his hometown of Little River Bend to unlock the secrets of his own past -- secrets that drove him years ago to almost destroy his family in one night of senseless violence. Released from treatment, but shunned by his neighbors, Somers is determined to heal the bird and release her to freedom. Watching from afar is a troubled little boy who lost his ability to speak after witnessing his father's death in a hunting accident. Slowly, an emotional bond grows between this lonely child, his mother, and the strange man who seems to have the ability to heal. Set in the majestic snow-covered spruce forests of the Pacific Northwest, this stunning literary debut explores the enduring strength of human compassion and the redemptive power of nature.", "genre": ["Fiction", "Romance", "Roman", "Family", "Canada", "Suspense", "Mystery"], "author": "Stuart   Harrison", "rating": "3.79", "pages": "Paperback"}, {"id": 1641184, "title": "The Card: A Story of Adventure in the Five Towns", "blurb": "Enoch Arnold Bennett (1867-1931) was a British novelist.

He was born in a modest house in Hanley in the Potteries district of Staffordshire. At age 21 he went to London as a solicitor's clerk. He won a literary competition in Tit Bits magazine in 1889 and was encouraged to take up journalism full time. From 1900 he devoted himself full time to writing, giving up the editorship and writing much serious criticism, and also theatre journalism, one of his special interests. In 1902 Anna of the Five Towns, the first of a succession of stories which detailed life in the Potteries, appeared. In 1908 The Old Wives' Tale was published, and was an immediate success throughout the English-speaking world. His most famous works are the Clayhanger (1910) trilogy and The Old Wives' Tale. These books draw on his experience of life in the Potteries, as did most of his best work. Among his other books are: The Grand Babylon Hotel (1902), The Grim Smile of the Five Towns (1907), Hilda Lessways (1911), The Author's Craft (1914), The Lion's Share (1916), and The Roll-Call (1919).\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Humor", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Novels", "Literature", "20th Century", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Audiobook", "Humor", "Comedy"], "author": "Arnold Bennett", "rating": "3.88", "pages": null}, {"id": 1641212, "title": "Annals of a Quiet Neighbourhood", "blurb": "George MacDonald (1824-1905) was a Scottish author, poet, and Christian minister.

C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his master. Even Mark Twain, who initially despised MacDonald, became friends with him. MacDonald grew up influenced by his Congregational Church, with an atmosphere of Calvinism. But MacDonald never felt comfortable with some aspects of Calvinist doctrine. Later novels, such as Robert Falconer (1868) and Lilith (1895), show a distaste for the Calvinist idea that God's electing love is limited to some and denied to others. Especially in his Unspoken Sermons (1867-89) he shows a highly developed theology. His best-known works are Phantastes (1858), At the Back of the North Wind (1871) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872), all fantasy novels, and fairy tales such as - The Light Princess (1867), The Golden Key (1867), and The Wise Woman (1875).\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Christian Fiction", "Classics", "Christian", "Literature", "19th Century", "Religion", "Theology", "Religion", "Christianity", "Philosophy"], "author": "George MacDonald", "rating": "4.26", "pages": null}, {"id": 1641298, "title": "Lifetimes: True Reincar", "blurb": "A person you've never met before seems strangely familiar. . . .

Nora, thirty-three, is a well-educated recent divorc e with two young children. Lark is twenty-four, a disaffected, young, homosexual man.

He has pursued four distinct careers: as a pianist, as a composer, as a pioneering conductor who introduced the worksof such composers as Ives, Varese, and Cowell, and as a musical lexicographer who has achieved world-wide recognition, particularly as editor of the highly-respected Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, a reference work renowned for its highly imaginative, lively, and gem-like entries. In Perfect Pitch, his fast-paced and often hilarious autobiography, Slonimsky recounts in fascinating detail a life that spans the whole of twentieth-century music, ranging from his childhood in St. Petersburg, where he studied piano with his illustrious aunt, Isabelle Vengerova, to his yearsas secretary and piano pounder to Serge Koussevitzky, to his present career as musical lexicographer. He describes the extraordinary accomplishments of members of his family; Russia before, during, and after the Revolution; his successful appearances as conductor in Paris, Berlin, and New York, as well as his fall from grace at the Hollywood Bowl; the whimsical pleasures of lexicographical detective work; unexpected fame and fortune as a game show contestant; and much more. Along the way, the reader meets famous personalities as seen through Slonimsky's eyes, including Igor Stravinsky, Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, Sergei Prokofiev, Leonard Bernstein, John Cage, and Frank Zappa.

It served as a colonial gateway to the world, witnessed the Boston Tea Party, and helped Boston transform itself from an outpost of a few hardy settlers into a bustling metropolis and self-proclaimed hub of the universe. Yet for hundreds of years, Eric Jay Dolin points out, Boston Harbor was also a cesspool. Long before Bostonians dumped tea into the harbor to protest English taxes, they dumped sewage there. As the Boston area grew and prospered, its sewage problems worsened, as did the harbor's health, to the point where in the 1980s it was considered the most polluted harbor in the country and ridiculed as the harbor of shame. history, Boston Harbor was dramatically cleaned up. All it took was two lawsuits, two courts, dozens of lawyers, the creation of a powerful sewage authority, thousands of workers, millions of labor hours, and billions of dollars. Sewage management is rarely as compelling and exciting as higher profile environmental issues such as global climate change, preserving endangered species, or protecting tropical rainforests. But it can be, as Dolin shows in this engaging narrative account. Boston's struggle to deal with its sewage is an epic story of failure and success, replete with colorful characters, political, bureaucratic, and legal twists and turns, engineering feats, and massive amounts of money. In the end, success hinged on the often overlooked yet monumentally important act of responsibly disposing of the waste people produce every day.", "genre": ["History"], "author": "Eric Jay Dolin", "rating": "3.56", "pages": "Hardcover"}, {"id": 1642445, "title": "Kodansha's Furigana Japanese English Dictionary", "blurb": "Browsing through the pages of Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary, you will notice something different: none of the Japanese entry words appearing in this book have been romanized. Some people may be surprised by this feature, especially in that the book is seen as suitable for even absolute beginners. Others (particularly the Japanese-language instructors who pointed out the need for such a publication) will be delighted to find that a full-fledged furigana Japanese-English dictionary is finally available.What is furigana and why is it so important? Furigana refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to show the pronunciation of the Chinese character. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other publications either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all the Japanese words and sentences. Previously, romanized Japanese dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Recently, however, an increasing number of influential curriculums around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers studying under such curriculums will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary like Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with familiar and authentic kana script.But it does not end there. The comprehensive 16,000-word basic vocabulary comprises a generous and balanced selection of native Japanese words, kanji compounds, and foreign loanwords. Precise and informative definitions, written specifically for English speakers, offer expert guidance on points of grammar, meaning, style, orthography, pronunciation, and punctuation. Concise and insightful explanations clarify even the most troublesome cultural terms. In addition there are 50,000 sample sentences that provide a context-based understanding of how words are linked together to form authentic and natural Japanese sentences.Features that help expand word power and increase vocabulary skills have also been included in Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary. Common collocations, derivatives, and compounds show how word parts fit and work together. Comprehensive cross-referencing makes the learner aware of common synonyms and antonyms, clarifying both meaning and usage. Finally, three appendices explain in detail such complicated areas as conjugating verbs and adjectives, counting, and articulating foreign place names in Japanese.All of this and more in a portable format and at affordable price.

The Emma was not, as you might suppose, a fishing smack, but old Jim Deck's ancient and unroadworthy bicycle, on which he hung various seamanlike things such as an anchor and fenders and a lantern. Distracted by Tamzin's shout of greeting, Jim careered down Dunsford's main street into a baker's van; in no time at all he was resting on a bed of rich cakes, and when he was finally hauled to the surface the damage had been done, not only to the cakes which would have to paid for, but to old Jim himself Tamzin decided, quite arbitrarily according to her father the Vicar, that it was her fault and that therefore she should pay. Her fiiends rallied round, and a great idea was born. They would write, print, publish and sell a local newspaper\u2014the Westling News\u2014and pay the baker out of their profits. So began a most adventurous time for all of them, because in their search for news they discovered a colorado beetle and then lost it, to Diccon's anguish; a motor-propelled invalid chair for old Jim which was the cause of several escapades; the astonishing fact that old Jim had a father, a man who reduced even Jim himself to comparative insignificance; and above all the arrival of a family of rare birds\u2014hoopoes\u2014at the castle.

Halperin revisits and refines the argument he put forward in his classic One Hundred Years of Homosexuality: that hetero- and homosexuality are not biologically constituted but are, instead, historically and culturally produced. How to Do the History of Homosexuality expands on this view, updates it, answers its critics, and makes greater allowance for continuities in the history of sexuality. Above all, Halperin offers a vigorous defense of the historicist approach to the construction of sexuality, an approach that sets a premium on the description of other societies in all their irreducible specificity and does not force them to fit our own conceptions of what sexuality is or ought to be.Dealing both with male homosexuality and with lesbianism, this study imparts to the history of sexuality a renewed sense of adventure and daring. It recovers the radical design of Michel Foucault's epochal work, salvaging Foucault's insights from common misapprehensions and making them newly available to historians, so that they can once again provide a powerful impetus for innovation in the field. Far from having exhausted Foucault's revolutionary ideas, Halperin maintains that we have yet to come to terms with their startling implications. Exploring the broader significance of historicizing desire, Halperin questions the tendency among scholars to reduce the history of sexuality to a mere history of sexual classifications instead of a history of human subjectivity itself. Finally, in a theoretical tour de force, Halperin offers an altogether new strategy for approaching the history of homosexuality\u2014one that can accommodate both ruptures and continuities, both identity and difference in sexual experiences across time and space.Impassioned but judicious, controversial but deeply informed, How to Do the History of Homosexuality is a book rich in suggestive propositions as well as eye-opening details. It will prove to be essential reading for anyone interested in the history of sexuality.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "LGBT", "Queer", "Nonfiction", "LGBT", "Sexuality", "GLBT", "Queer Studies", "Academic", "Academia", "Feminism"], "author": "David M.

Cr\nCharles Peterson entered the jazz world of New York as a guitarist but made his true contribution documenting an era and its most notable performers. A photographer whose images captured the passion and intensity of his subjects, Peterson took up the camera in the mid-1930s and transformed himself from a performer on stage to a visual recorder and observer of the stage. Creating a photographic style that combines artistic sensibility and technical skill, he became a preeminent New York jazz photographer of the pre-bebop, small combos and Big Band era. A deep love of jazz led Peterson to the legendary clubs of Harlem, 52nd Street, and Greenwich Village; concert halls and ballrooms; jam sessions; recording studios; backstage get-togethers; and private parties. As a jazz scene insider, Peterson had access to all of these formal and informal venues and was often recommended to shoot special events by musicians, record producers, and club owners because, as Eddie Condon once noted, he knows how to handle musicians. He won't bother them when he shouldn't bother them and he'll get what you want. And he did. Among the countless subjects he enshrined on film are Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Zutty Singleton, Fats Waller, Mildred Bailey, Cab Calloway, Pee Wee Russell, Lester Young, and Jack Teagarden. Peterson's photographs expose a startling contrast between integrated bandstands and audiences and the segregated world, and reveal the determination of those who refused to be confined by such oppressive conventions of the time. They depict musicianship and camaraderie, dancing, and technical innovation, as well as the harsh contrast of an all-too-pervasive alcoholism that interrupted the lives of many in that New York scene. Jazz historian and critic W. Royal Stokes provides commentary, historical and biographical information, and lively anecdotes that connect the musicians featured in Peterson's photographs to each other and to the mus\n...more", "genre": ["Music"], "author": "W.

As it spread by conquest in the 7th century, Islam encountered many new and foreign traditions, including the work of Aristotle. This repeatedly raised a vital question: were non-Islamic ideas to be considered part of the One Truth?In the 9th century, al-Kindi affirmed that philosophy and religion are merely different methods of pursuing the One Truth. Similarly (but more specifically), al-Farabi said that logic is the universal law of regulated thought, while revealed religion expresses truth in the symbols of a particular place and culture.In the 11th century, ibn Sina (Avicenna) solidified Aristotle's importance in the Islamic world and said that philosophy is the only source of knowledge -- and knowledge is the source of salvation. Avicenna said we begin with what we know, and proceed through a hierarchy of sciences toward what we don't know, culminating in First Philosophy. Avicenna famously distinguished between essence and existence. This led to the philosophical concept of Necessary Existence (i.e. God). Avicenna said happiness is found not in sense perception, but in objects of the intellect; salvation involves correct habits of the soul and a primary understanding of Being -- i.e. contemplation of the purely divine.Al-Ghazali (1058-1111) criticized Avicenna, insisting that salvation is beyond demonstrative knowledge, and can be gained only in the immediate experience of mysticism. Ibn Rushd, or Averroes (1126-1196), worked to restore theindependence of philosophy, separating it from religion. He said that religion may guide the masses to salvation, while philosophy -- grasped only by a small elite -- produces the speculative virtues that are necessary for attaining truth and immortality of the soul.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "History", "Religion", "Nonfiction", "Audiobook", "Religion", "Islam", "Science"], "author": "Thomas Gaskill", "rating": "3.73", "pages": "0"}, {"id": 1645578, "title": "Beloved Land: The World of Emily Carr", "blurb": "George Bowering observed that in British Columbia there is more geography than there is history. Perhaps no one has understood this geography quite as intimately as painter and writer Emily Carr. Born and buried in Victoria, on Vancouver Island, she spent her entire creative life trying to capture the spirit of the place. Beloved Land: The World of Emily Carr is a seductive record of that endeavour, containing 40 reproductions of Carr's dark and sensuous paintings of forest, skies and totem poles, accompanied by passages from her stories, journals, and letters. Though Carr's voluminous writings have been collected in a separate volume, The Complete Writings of Emily Carr, it's instructive to see her words so thoughtfully paired with her paintings here. A lone cedar trunk emerging from a deep green and purple rain forest, for example, is accompanied by a passage from Carr's autobiography, Growing Pains, that begins: I went no more then to the far villages, but to the deep, quiet woods near home where I sat staring, staring, staring--half lost.\u0085  Slimmer and more selective than Doris Shadbolt's authoritative The Art of Emily Carr, Beloved Land provides an introduction to Carr's work and makes excellent bedside or seaside reading.

He provides concrete descriptions of the ways individuals transform during the course of successive incarnations and specific examples of how karma works. Steiner also provides practical exercises that lead us to experience the reality of reincarnation. He believed that, by experiencing the reality of successive earth lives, we can form a foundation for a spiritual understanding of the relationship between humankind and the cosmos.These talks contain some of Steiner's most important teachings on reincarnation and karma. His examples and exercises can lead us to direct knowledge of the laws of reincarnation and karma.Topics include: How to perceive directly the part of our being that passes through many lives on earth; how to develop a feeling memory, which we need before we are able to experience reincarnation; thought exercises for gaining knowledge of reincarnation and karma; examples of how karma works between incarnations; how knowledge of reincarnation and karma affects our moral life.This volume is a translation from German of Wiederverk\ufffdrperung und Karma und ihre Bedeutung f\ufffdr die Kultur der Gegenwart (GA 135).\n...more", "genre": ["Spirituality", "Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "Religion", "Buddhism"], "author": "Rudolf Steiner", "rating": "4.01", "pages": "104"}, {"id": 1645648, "title": "The Aeneid", "blurb": "The Aeneid \u2013 thrilling, terrifying and poignant in equal measure \u2013 has inspired centuries of artists, writers and musicians.Virgil\u2019s epic tale tells the story of Aeneas, a Trojan hero, who flees his city after its fall, with his father Anchises and his young son Ascanius \u2013 for Aeneas is destined to found Rome and father the Roman race.

In 1794, the first Orthodox missionary monks arrived at Kodiak to found what they believed would be an indigenous Orthodox Church in the New World. They recognized as integral to their mission the defense of Native people who were being abused, exploited and enslaved by an unjust regime. The mission understood its function in cosmic terms: to sanctify, here and now, this land, these people, and bring them to the unity-in-love which is the goal of authentic Christian mission. The history of the Alaskan Church confirms the eternal and indestructible character of the Church's vision, integrating into her worship the cosmic, scriptural and eschatological dimension of faith. Among the Native Americans in Alaska, Orthodoxy has become an integral part of an authentically American culture. Consequently it is appropriate that an Orthodox theology of mission should originate from the Alaskan context. If an American Orthodox missiology is to emerge, its formulation should serve not only the Church in America but contribute to the clarification of Orthodox theology for the universal Church as well. \nArchpriest Michael J. Oleska, Alaskan Orthodox missionary for nearly three decades, completed his doctoral work in Church History and Patristics at the Orthodox Theological Faculty in Presov, Slovakia, in 1988.

He wrote accessibly, on traditional themes - the natural world, human relationships, transience and mortality. And yet his poetry is alive with the critical intelligence that came from years of writing non-fiction and reviewing verse. Branch-Lines captures the range of Thomas\u2019s achievement, not least by combining poetry with prose. In this unique collection, fifty-five contemporary poets reflect on Thomas\u2019s craftsmanship and enduring power. Some have chosen poems of their own in which they detect his influence, others have written new poems in his honour. Each poet has also contributed a piece of prose, and the volume contains an introduction, four critical essays, illustrations, a Foreword by Andrew Motion and an Afterword by Michael Longley. Branch-Lines offers a fascinating perspective on the workings of literary influence, with personal insights from some of the leading poet-critics of our time. 'The collection has a double value.

More often they are regarded as inconsequential to the study of the modern, or, at best, seen as representative of traditional beliefs that are overcome and left behind in the transformation toward modernity. In Civilization and Monsters Gerald Figal asserts that discourse on the fantastic was at the heart of the historical configuration of Japanese modernity\u2014that the representation of the magical and mysterious played an integral part in the production of modernity beginning in Meiji Japan (1868\u20131912).\tAfter discussing the role of the fantastic in everyday Japan at the eve of the Meiji period, Figal draws new connections between folklorists, writers, educators, state ideologues, and policymakers, all of whom crossed paths in a contest over supernatural terrain. He shows the ways in which a determined Meiji state was engaged in a battle to suppress, denigrate, manipulate, or reincorporate folk belief as part of an effort toward the consolidation of a modern national culture. Modern medicine and education, functioning as a means for the state to exercise its power, redefined folk practices as a source of evil. Diverse local spirits were supplanted by a new Japanese Spirit, embodied by the newly constituted emperor, the supernatural source of the nation\u2019s strength. The monsters of folklore were identified, catalogued, and characterized according to a new regime of modern reason. But whether engaged to support state power and forge a national citizenry or to critique the arbitrary nature of that power, the fantastic, as Figal maintains, is the constant condition of Japanese modernity in all its contradictions. Furthermore, he argues, modernity in general is born of fantasy in ways that have scarcely been recognized. \tBringing unexplored and provocative new ideas to the Japan specialist, Civilization and Monsters will also appeal to readers concerned with issues of modernity in general.", "genre": ["History", "Japan", "Nonfiction", "Japanese History", "Folklore", "Japanese Literature"], "author": "Gerald Figal", "rating": "3.43", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 1649539, "title": "Awake and Dreaming", "blurb": "Theo has always dreamed of belonging to a real family.

Down, Up, and Over draws on their religious experience, and the example of their faith and witness, to develop a constructive theology of liberation. African American belief structures and hope practices blossom from the black folk's religious encounters with God, Hopkins contends. The first half of his ambitious work reconstructs the cultural matrix of African American religion-a total way of life formed by Protestantism, American culture, and the institution of slavery (1619-1865)-in which racial identities developed. Whites from Europe and blacks from Africa arrived with specific, differing views of God, faith, practice, and humanity. Hopkins recreates their worldviews and how white theology sought to remake African Americans into naturally inferior beings divinely ordained into subservience. The counter voice of enslaved blacks begets the Spirit of Liberation. Tracking that Spirit, Hopkins crafts an explicit black theology of the Spirit of Liberation for us (God, chapter 4), with us (Jesus, chapter 5), and in us (human purpose, chapter 6). Out of the crucible of slavery emerges the lineaments of a constructive religious vision: the constitution of a new self and a divinely purposed liberation toward full spiritual and material humanity. Hopkins sweeping vision, impressive scholarship, and astute social analysis make for a fascinating and important volume, one that can help all readers find meaning and purpose in the daunting 350-year pilgrimage of African Americans.\n...more", "genre": ["Race"], "author": "Dwight N.
