But what of those women who actually claimed the name witch as their own? In the pages of her secret journal, Mary Nuttall reveals what it is like to live in a climate of mistrust and piety in which differences are dangerous and rumors can kill, where she must hide her heritage as a healer and pagan. With a sure hand, she describes her beloved grandmother's trial and hanging as a witch, her own rescue by a mysterious noblewoman, and her eventual passage to the New World and the forest settlement of Beulah. There Mary falls under a curtain of suspicion when she willingly chooses to explore the dark woods shunned by the fearful colonists and makes friends with some of the spiritual native people. When several girls in the community begin to shriek and swoon, and the same minister who damned Mary's grandmother comes to search for signs of witchcraft, Mary is subjected to close and deadly scrutiny. Breaking with most historical fiction about witchcraft (such as Elizabeth Speare's The Witch of Blackbird Pond), British author Celia Rees raises the stakes and the tension by placing a real witch at the center of her story.

Attempts to train and develop the ideal leader, by definition, cannot produce expected results.This book helps managers identify the style of real people, not imaginary templates, and provides tools to build a team of people with complementary strengths and weaknesses, based on their different management styles.This book provides a methodology to classify styles identify their strengths and weaknesses, and predict how each style will make decisions, staff, motivate, and communicate; in a word, manage.Management / Mismanagement Styles is based on Dr. Adizes 30 years of consulting experience worldwide, from start-ups to Fortune 100 companies.

The material from all three has been faithfully transcribed and researched by June Lewis, who herself lives in Fairford.The story that unfolds, amongst the fascinating minutae of household detail, is one of conflict of love between two suitors who press Sarah - now an independent woman of some means - for her hand. Unlike other diaries or travelogues of more famous contemporaries such as Dorthy Wordsworth or Florence Nightingale, Sarah's diary was not meant for anyone else's eyes. It is too frank to have been designed for any other purpose than a secret repository for her heartfelt feelings. And herein is its charm and value as one imagines Sarah writing in her tiny notebooks by the light of a candle - now some 130 years later, we can share her secret thoughts with her.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Sarah Thomas", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "176"}, {"id": 300144, "title": "Greek Gods, Human Lives: What We Can Learn from Myths", "blurb": "Why the Greek myths, more than those of any other culture, continue to captivate us The mythology of ancient Greece has fascinated readers for two millennia and has formed the basis of Western civilization.

The Greek gods are a perennial source of delight because they seem so much like us: in their rages, their love affairs, and their obsession with honor, the gods often appear all too human. In Greek Gods, Human Lives, preeminent classicist Mary Lefkowitz reintroduces readers to the literature of ancient Greece. Lefkowitz demonstrates that these stories, although endlessly entertaining, are never frivolous. The Greek myths\u2014as told by Homer, Ovid, Virgil, and many others\u2014offer crucial lessons about human experience. Greek mythology makes vivid the fact that the gods control every aspect of the lives of mortals, but not in ways that modern audiences have properly understood. We can learn much from these myths, Lefkowitz shows, if we understand that they are stories about religious experience\u2014about the meaning of divinity, the nature of justice, and the limitations of human knowledge. These myths spoke to ancient audiences and helped them to comprehend their world. With Mary Lefkowitz as an interpreter, these myths speak to us as well.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Fantasy", "Mythology", "History", "Philosophy"], "author": "Mary R.

In the process, he suggests that Europe's strength lies increasingly in embracing diversity and improvisation, not bigness and regimentation.

Her works are credited by many with creating and sustaining new critical interest not only in the work of major modernist poets such as Yeats, Pound, Eliot, and Williams but also in the postwar tradition of American poetic innovation that ranges from the Black Mountain poets, through the New York School and concrete poetry, to the Language Poets of the 1980s and '90s.In Differentials, Perloff explores and defends her belief in the power of close reading, a strategy often maligned as reactionary in today's critical climate but which, when construed differentially, is vital, she believes, to any true understanding of a literary or poetic work, irrespective of how traditional or experimental it is. Perloff also examines key issues in modernism, from Eliot's conservative poetics and Pound's nominalism to translation theory (Wittgenstein, Eugene Jolas, Haroldo de Campos), and the contemporary avant garde, as represented by writers like Susan Howe, Tom Raworth, Rae Armantrout, Ron Silliman, Ronald Johnson, Caroline Bergvall, and Kenneth Goldsmith.Ultimately, Perloff's most important offerings in Differentials are her remarkably original reflections on the aesthetic process: on how poetry works, and what it means, in and for our time.\n...more", "genre": ["Poetry", "Criticism", "Literary Criticism"], "author": "Marjorie Perloff", "rating": "3.90", "pages": "344"}, {"id": 300815, "title": "Barthes para principiantes", "blurb": "Roland Barthes es mas conocido como semiologo: alguien que estudia la ciencia de los signos.

In his old house in uptown New Orleans, Lew Griffin is alone...or almost. His relationship with Deborah is falling apart, his son, David, has disappeared again, leaving a note that sounds final. His friend Don Walsh, who is leaving the police department, is shot interrupting a robbery. And Lew is directionless: he hasn't written anything in years; he no longer teaches...there's nothing to fill his days. Even the attempt to discover the source of threatening letters to a friend leaves him feeling rootless and lost.Through five previous novels, James Sallis has enthralled and challenged readers as he has told the story of Lew Griffin, private detective, teacher, writer, poet, and a black man moving through time in a white man's world. And now Lew Griffin stands alone in a dark room, looking out. Behind him on the bed is a body. Wind pecks at the window. Traffic sounds drift aimlessly in. He thinks if he doesn't speak, doesn't think about what happened, somehow things will be all right again. He thinks about his own life, about the other's, about how the two of them came to be here....In a story as much about identity as it is about crime, Sallis has held a mirror up to society and culture, while at the same time setting Lew Griffin the task of discovering who he is. As the detective stands in that dark room, the answers begin to come clear and the highly acclaimed series builds to a brilliantly constructed climax that will resonate in readers' minds long after the story is finished.", "genre": ["Mystery", "Crime", "Noir", "Hard Boiled"], "author": "James Sallis", "rating": "4.13", "pages": "252"}, {"id": 300901, "title": "Sorrow's Kitchen Poems by James Sallis", "blurb": "Slightly surrealistic, meditative, elegiac, this collection of poetry from author James Sallis is concerned with aging, relationships, loss, and love.

The short summer gives her little time to look, and when she finds a sheltered valley with a herd of hardy steppe horses, she decides to stay and prepare for the long glacial winter ahead. Living with the Clan has taught Ayla many skills but not real hunting. She finally knows she can survive when she traps a horse, which gives her meat and a warm pelt for the winter, but fate has bestowed a greater gift, an orphaned foal with whom she develops a unique kinship. One winter extends to more; she discovers a way to make fire more quickly and a wounded cave lion cub joins her unusual family, but her beloved animals don't fulfill her restless need for human companionship. Then she hears the sound of a man screaming in pain. She saves tall, handsome Jondalar, who brings her a language to speak and an awakening of love and desire, but Ayla is torn between her fear of leaving her valley and her hope of living with her own kind.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Historical", "Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Prehistoric", "Adventure", "Adult", "Novels", "Adult Fiction"], "author": "Jean M.

I cannot help regarding it as a grand sequel for my own The Imperial Presidency.---Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.Has the imperial presidency returned? This question has been on the minds of many contemporary political observers, as recent American administrations have aimed to consolidate power.In The New Imperial Presidency, Andrew Rudalevige suggests that the congressional framework meant to advise and constrain presidential conduct since Watergate has slowly eroded. Rudalevige describes the evolution of executive power in our separated system of governance. He discusses the abuse of power that prompted what he calls the resurgence regime against the imperial presidency and inquires as to how and why---over the three decades that followed Watergate---presidents have regained their standing.Chief executives have always sought to interpret constitutional powers broadly. The ambitious president can choose from an array of strategies for pushing against congressional authority; finding scant resistance, he will attempt to expand executive control. Rudalevige's important and timely work reminds us that the freedoms secured by our system of checks and balances do not proceed automatically but depend on the exertions of public servants and the citizens they serve.

In order for parents to do this, however, society must first face an unrecognized dilemma of major proportions. While Dr. Greenspan's research demonstrates that children in the first few years of life need intense one-to-one nurturing to develop their full cognitive and emotional abilities, over 50 percent of families are relying on out-of-home care that, for the most part, does not provide such nurture. In order to resolve this dilemma, he offers a radical redefinition of family life. Without suggesting that either parent give up a career, he presents a wide variety of practical solutions that make children the top priority-and the equal responsibility-of both parents. He vividly describes tag team care, serial careers, other ways to balance at-home care and daycare, ways to make the new technologies that allow working at home a benefit for both adult and child, and the four-thirds solution, in which both parents work two-thirds of the time.A Merloyd Lawrence Book", "genre": ["Parenting"], "author": "Stanley I.

The hunts range from upland birds and waterfowl to prized big game animals like elk, bear, and sheep amid lofty peaks. There are goat pursuits among ice-glazed mountain spires, and close encounters with grizzlies in the black timber. He survives lion charges and buffalo attacks, and stumbles on elephants.

In creative engagement with such British intellectuals as John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle, Matthew Arnold, Leslie Stephen, John Ruskin, James Bryce, and Goldwin Smith, these critical Americans articulated political ideals and cultural standards to suit the burgeoning mass democracy the Civil War had created. This transatlantic framework informed their notions of educative citizenship, print-based democratic politics, critically informed cultural dissemination, and a temperate, deliberative foreign policy.

Crypt 33 - which was the number on the vault in the Los Angeles morgue where Marilyn's body was placed - provides the final word on the life and death of Marilyn Monroe. It clears the CIA of alleged conspiracy in the murder, but indicts previously unnamed underworld killers verified by separate but well-connected independent sources. The book implicates those at the highest level of government, and it names the man who brought the killers into the star's home - a friend who betrayed her. Crypt 33 provides all the sordid and previously unknown details, including a day-by-day account of aspiring actress Norma Jeane Baker's transformation into the screen icon Marilyn Monroe; intimate details of the actress's romance with Frank Sinatra; Marilyn's involvement with Sam Giancana; the fact that teamster ruler Jimmy Hoffa bugged Marilyn's phones hoping to catch incriminating conversations with her lover, Robert Kennedy; and Crypt 33 answers the ultimate question: Who ordered the hit on Marilyn?

He questions the so-called failing schools, discusses the phenomenon of summer loss, provides international comparisons, and presents data to argue that investing in universal quality preschool pays off in the long run. He even attempts to enter the mind of the father of American public education, Horace Mann, to see what he might think about the nuttiness of today's policies.Bracey believes that our only hope to save the public school system is for teachers, teacher educators, and administrators to help speed up the needed perspective transformation.

Thomas Jefferson, a brilliant political thinker, is perhaps best known for the Declaration of Independence, but he was a man of extraordinarily wide interests.He was exceptionally controversial in his own time, and many of his ideas remain the subject of national debate. In his arguments for a system of general education, for local rather than central authority, for caution in international affairs, for religious and intellectual freedom, and for economic and social justice, Jefferson defined the issues that still direct our national political life centuries after the nation's formation. This volume will give readers the opportunity to reassess one of our most influential presidents.Jefferson's First Inaugural Address is a resounding statement of faith in a democracy of enlightened people. His Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) is an invaluable record of the landscape, inhabitants, life, and daily customs of America in the Revolutionary and early national eras. His letters, more than two hundred and fifty of which are gathered here, are brilliant urbane missives to such men as Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, Lafayette, John Adams and James Madison. His slim Autobiography (1821), written for my own more ready reference, and for the information of my family, hardly hints at the influence and impact he had as Secretary of State under George Washington, Minister to France, opposition-party Vice President to John Adams, and, after leaving the presidency, founder of the University of Virginia.His public papers and addresses fully demonstrate both the breadth of his interests and the power of his expressive mind. Extensively read (his personal library of ten thousand volumes became the foundation of the Library of Congress) and widely traveled, Jefferson wrote with ease and spontaneity about science, archaeology, botany and gardening, religion, literature, architecture, education, the habits of his fellow citizens, and, of course, his beloved home, Monticello.Jefferson's prose has an energy, clarity, and charming off-handedness, consistent with his conviction that style in writing should impose no barrier between the most educated and the most common reader. For those who want a renewed sense of the opportunity for human freedom that the United States represented to its founders, this is an indispensable book.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Politics", "Biography", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Military History", "American Revolution", "Classics", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Literature", "American"], "author": "Thomas Jefferson", "rating": "4.22", "pages": "1600"}, {"id": 303222, "title": "Claire of the Wild Rose Inn", "blurb": "Struggling with financial difficulties due to the Prohibition and her brother's wish to make the inn into a speakeasy, Claire MacKenzie is drawn into a mystery regarding the murder of the town drunk and fears her brother may be involved.\nStruggling with financial difficulties due to the Prohibition and her brother's wish to make the inn into a speakeasy, Claire MacKenzie is drawn into a mystery regarding the murder of the town drunk and fears her brother may be involved.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Young Adult", "Romance", "Historical", "Fiction"], "author": "Jennifer Armstrong", "rating": "3.86", "pages": "175"}, {"id": 303234, "title": "The Century for Young People", "blurb": "The 20th century brought seeds of change, global nightmares, years of doubt, and machine dreams.

Is that a fair standard to judge against?\u201d In the pages of \nWhy Do I Love These People?\n, Po Bronson takes us on an extraordinary journey. It begins on a river in Texas, where a mother gets trapped underwater and has to bargain for her own life and that of her kids. Then, a father and his daughter return to their tiny rice-growing village in China, hoping to rekindle their love for each other inside the walls of his childhood home. Next, a son puts forth a riddle, asking us to understand what his first experience of God has to do with his Mexican American mother.Every step\u2013and every family\u2013on this journey is real. Calling upon his gift for powerful nonfiction narrative and philosophical insight, Bronson explores the incredibly complicated feelings that we have for our families. Each chapter introduces us to two people\u2013a father and his son, a daughter and her mother, a wife and her husband\u2013and we come to know them as intimately as characters in a novel, following the story of their relationship as they struggle resiliently through the kinds of hardships all families endure. Some of the people manage to save their relationship, while others find a better life only after letting the relationship go. From their efforts, the wisdom in this book emerges. We are left feeling emotionally raw but grounded\u2013and better prepared to love, through both hard times and good time.In these twenty mesmerizing stories, we discover what is essential and elemental to all families and, in doing so, slowly abolish the fantasies and fictions we have about those we fight to stay connected to.In \nWhy Do I Love These People?\n, Bronson shows us that we are united by our yearnings and aspirations: Family is not our dividing line, but our common ground.From the Hardcover edition.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Self Help", "Relationships", "Short Stories", "Parenting", "Family", "Biography", "Audiobook", "Autobiography", "Memoir"], "author": "Po Bronson", "rating": "3.68", "pages": "400"}, {"id": 304496, "title": "Fun Works: Creating Places Where People Love to Work", "blurb": "Yerkes offers tips, examples, and motivation to help readers, their coworkers, and their customers unleash the power of fun in the workplace.

Reviewed and praised in dozens of electronics and educational magazines, it is used as a text by major corporations, colleges, high schools, military schools and trade schools. It has been studied by education programs at colleges across the United States. This book was making wise cracks in the corner before anyone thought of designing books for dummies and idiots; some say it helped to inspire that industry.It may be the only introduction to electronics books with back cover comments by Dave Barry, Ray Bradbury, Clive Cussler, and George Garrett, as well as recomendations from Robert Hazen, Bob Mostafapour, Dr. Roger Young, Dr. Wayne Green, Scott Rundle, Brian Battles, Michelle Guido, Herb Reichert and Emil Venere.

Lacey Farrell, a rising star on the Manhattan real estate scene, is witness to a murder - and to the final words of the victim. The dying woman is convinced her attacker was after her dead daughter's journal, which Lacey gives to the police, but not before making a copy for herself. It's an impulse that later proves nearly fatal. Placed in the witness protection programme and sent to live in Minneapolis, Lacey must assume a fake identity, at least until the killer can be brought to trial. There she meets Tom Lynch, a radio talk-show host whom she tentatively begins to date - until the strain of her deception makes her break it off. Then she discovers the killer has traced her whereabouts. Armed with nothing more than her own courage and clues from the journal, Lacey heads back to New York determined to uncover who is behind the deaths of the two women...before she is the next casualty.\n...more", "genre": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Suspense", "Thriller", "Thriller", "Mystery Thriller", "Mystery", "Crime", "Adult", "Adult Fiction", "Romance", "Novels"], "author": "Mary Higgins Clark", "rating": "3.90", "pages": "318"}, {"id": 304700, "title": "Hagakure.

Middletown, America is a book of hope.All Americans were hit with some degree of trauma on September 11, 2001, but no place was hit harder than Middletown, New Jersey. Gail Sheehy spent the better part of two years walking the journey from grief toward renewal with \ufb01fty members of the community that lost more people in the World Trade Center than any other outside New York City. Her subjects are the women, men, and children who remained after the devastation and who are putting their lives back together.Sheehy tells the story of four widowed moms from New Jersey who started out scarcely knowing the difference between the House and the Senate, yet turned their sorrow and anger into action and became formidable witnesses to the failures of the country\u2019s leadership to connect the dots before September 11. Sheehy follows the four moms as they \ufb01ght White House attempts to thwart the independent commission investigating 9/11 and expose efforts at a cover-up.What would become of the young wives carrying children their husbands would never see, wives who had watched their dreams literally go up in smoke in that amphitheater of death across the river? Amazingly, each \ufb01nds her own door to the light. Here, too, is the story of the widow and widower who met in the waiting room of a mental-health agency and brought each other back from the brink of despair across a bridge of love. Sheehy also reveals how bereft mothers who will never have another son or daughter found reasons to recommit to life. And she follows in the footsteps of the robbed children, documenting the incredible resilience of four-year-olds, the anger of teenagers, the courage of sisters and brothers.Sheehy follows survivors who escaped the burning towers only to \ufb01nd themselves trapped inside a tower of inner torment, from which it took love, family, and faith to free themselves. She is taken into the con\ufb01-dence of the night crew at Ground Zero, police of\ufb01cers who worked in that pit for eight months straight and then faced the \u201creturning home\u201d phenomenon. She recounts the confessions of religious leaders who struggled to explain the inexplicable to their \ufb02ocks.

Compact and affordable, The Concise Oxford Companion to American Literature contains over 2,000 entries, including brief biographies of important authors, plot summaries of individual works, descriptions of important literary movements, and a wealth of information on other aspects of Americanliterary life and history from the Colonial period to the modern era. It devotes approximately 325 of the biographical entries to contemporary writers, introducing such newcomers to the Companion as William Kennedy, Grace Paley, and Raymond Carver. The more specialized and esoteric entries from theoriginal have been omitted. Like its predecessor, The Concise Oxford Companion contains a thorough system of cross references to guide the reader to related information on a given topic, as well as a chronological Index outlining significant events in the literary and social history of the United States.\n...more", "genre": ["Reference"], "author": "James David Hart", "rating": "4.67", "pages": "512"}, {"id": 305510, "title": "Cymbeline", "blurb": "Cymbeline tells the story of a British king, Cymbeline, and his three children, presented as though they are in a fairy tale.

In Rabbi Jesus, the noted biblical scholar Bruce Chilton places Jesus within the context of his times to present a fresh, historically accurate, and revolutionary examination of the man who founded Christianity.Drawing on recent archaeological findings and new translations and interpretations of ancient texts, Chilton discusses in enlightening detail the philosophical and psychological foundations of Jesus\u2019 ideas and beliefs.

Chilton shows, for example, that the High Priest Caiaphas, as well as Pontius Pilate, played a central role in Jesus\u2019 execution. It is, however, Chilton\u2019s description of Jesus\u2019 role as a rabbi, or master, of Jewish oral traditions, as a teacher of the Cabala, and as a practitioner of a Galilean form of Judaism that emphasized direct communication with God that casts an entirely new light on the origins of Christianity.

She survived, but her world was destroyed. Her training as a philosopher could not help her make sense of things, and many of her fundamental assumptions about the nature of the self and the world it inhabits were shattered.At once a personal narrative of recovery and a philosophical exploration of trauma, this bravely and beautifully written book examines the undoing and remaking of a self in the aftermath of violence. It explores, from an interdisciplinary perspective, memory and truth, identity and self, autonomy and community. It offers imaginative access to the experience of a rape survivor as well as a reflective critique of a society in which women routinely fear and suffer sexual violence.As Brison observes, trauma disrupts memory, severs past from present, and incapacitates the ability to envision a future. Yet the act of bearing witness, she argues, facilitates recovery by integrating the experience into the survivor's life's story. She also argues for the importance, as well as the hazards, of using first-person narratives in understanding not only trauma, but also larger philosophical questions about what we can know and how we should live.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "Feminism", "Psychology", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Philosophy", "Theory", "Academic", "Womens", "Feminism", "Womens Studies", "Biography Memoir"], "author": "Susan J.

You'll soon gain enough programming know-how to write your own C++ applications. Why C++? C++ is arguably the most widely used programming language in existence. It's used in professional application development because of its immense flexibility, power, and efficiency. For high-performance code across a vast range of programming contexts, C++ is unrivalled. It's also much more accessible than many people assume. With the right guidance, getting a grip on C++ is easier than you might imagine. By developing your C++ skills, you'll learn a language already used by millions, and you'll acquire a new tool in your programming toolbox that is likely to be more powerful than any of the others. The Standard for C++ In 1998, the International Standard for C++, ISO/IEC 14882, was finally approved and adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS).

Photographer Ann Parker and writer Avon Neal spent a decade exploring towns, villages, and isolated farm communities along the Nile, across the Delta, down the Red Sea coast, and into the Sinai. On the walls of buildings ranging from alabaster factories to mud brick farmhouses they found brilliant murals illuminated by the desert sun, portraying beloved icons of the pilgrims' faith and scenes from the Koran. Their nearly one hundred and fifty color photographs and accompanying descriptions record the radiant palette of mostly self-taught artists.

Food Culture in the Ancient World draws on writings of classical authors such as Petronius, Galen, and Cato, as well as on archeological findings, to present intimate insight into ancient peoples. This volume will be indispensable as it complements classical history, cultural, and literature studies at the high school and college levels and will also inform the general reader.The book begins with an overview of the civilizations and their agricultural practices and trade. A full discussion of available foodstuffs describes the discovery, emergence, usage, and appraisals of a host of ingredients. A subsequent chapter covers food by civilization. Chapters on food preparation, the food professions, and eating habits provide a fascinating look at the social structure, with slaves and women preparing and serving food. Accounts of the gatherings of slaves and freedmen in taverns, inns, and bars and the notorious banquet, symposium, feast, and convivium of the elite are particularly intriguing and crucial to understanding male society. Other aspects of ancient life brought to life for the reader include food for soldiers, food in religious and funerary practices, and concepts of diet and nutrition.

As the blockbuster bestseller Freakonomics demonstrated, economics can explain everything, from why people behave the way they do to how governments and businesses organize themselves. But are the basic assumptions and conclusions in Freakonomics true? Does the free market usually lead to unintended and negative consequences? Quite the opposite, says John Lott, who holds a PhD in economics. In fact, says Lott, a wide range of fascinating and peculiar case studies prove the simple adage that if something is more costly, people will do less of it. And, in a refutation of Freakonomics' most controversial idea, Lott shows why legalized abortion leads to family breakdown, which leads to more crime. Extending its rigorous economic analysis even further to our political and criminal justice systems, Freedomnomics reveals: -How the free market creates incentives for people to behave honestly -How political campaign restrictions keep incumbents in power -Why affirmative action in police departments leads to higher crime rates -How women's suffrage led to a massive increase in the size of government -Why women become more conservative when they get married and more liberal when they get divorced -How secret ballots reduce voter participation -Why state-owned companies and government agencies are much more likely to engage in unfair predation than are private firms Entertaining, persuasive, and based on dozens of economic studies spanning decades, Freedomnomics not only shows how free markets really work but proves that, when it comes to promoting prosperity and economic justice, nothing works better.\n...more", "genre": ["Economics", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "Audiobook", "Philosophy", "Business", "Psychology", "Currency", "Money", "Economics", "Finance"], "author": "John R.

And Csardas is a deftly plotted saga of great power, beauty, and historical authenticity that follows the changing fortunes of three aristocratic European families--spanning two world wars and four countries, and brimming with richly drawn, unforgettable characters. Trying to found a dynasty against the inflexible caste system of the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire, stern Jewish banker Zsignmond Ferenc had married Marta Bogozy, a gay, charming woman of noble birth. Their daughters, The two enchanting Ferenc sisters, Malie and Eva, are the most sought-after young women in their small society. Little do they realize that their secure world of privilege is soon to be consumed in the holocaust of the First World War and subsequent events.Masterfully, Diane Pearson interweaves the story of Malie and Eva with the lives of the other Ferencs, their relatives, and the history of the troubled times--the socialist, fascist, and finally communist regimes; the scattering of the family and its struggle simply to survive; and the joyous reunion after World War II of those who do.This is a superbly written, poignant epic of war and peace--the brave, dignified, and sometimes cruel story of living, breathing characters whose hopes, failures, and triumphs will entrance readers everywhere.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Cultural", "Hungary", "Fiction", "Romance", "Historical", "Romance", "Historical Romance", "War", "World War II", "War", "War", "World War I", "Literature", "20th Century"], "author": "Diane Pearson", "rating": "4.17", "pages": "576"}, {"id": 309096, "title": "Voices of Summer", "blurb": "In the style of Csardas and The Summer of the Barshinskeys, best-selling author Diane Pearson once again creates a cast of vibrant characters and places them in a dazzling, memorable locale for us to enjoy. Her writing has been called hauntingly beautiful and compelling by her reviewers and fans, and she is sure to add to her growing popularity with Voices of Summer, in which we visit the shimmering Alps and eavesdrop on the backstage affairs of the little country town of Hochhauser. This Austrian village was no different from any of the others nestled in the Alps, except for one thing - its operetta company. Dreamchild of Willi Zimmerman, the town's exuberant mayor, the company brought music and gaiety to Hochhauser's little theater. It wasn't Salzburg or Vienna, but it had charm and a certain faded elegance. It also had Karl Gesner. Gesner's voice and stage presence made him the matinee idol of the audiences. Unfortunately, this attractiveness did not extend to his personality. Offstage, Gesner was a monster. Each season it became harder and harder to find a soprano willing to appear opposite him, but each season, that was exactly what Franz Busacher, the director, had to do. When, in desperation, Busacher persuaded Therese Aschmann to return to the stage after nearly twenty years in obscurity, years of loneliness and pain, no one could have imagined it was to be the beginning of the most extraordinary season Hochhauser had ever seen - a season of angry scenes and magical transformations, both onstage and off. Above all, it was to be a season in which love blossomed, often in the most unlikely places.

Since then, Lessing has delivered more than 30 major works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and drama, most notably her massive experimental novel, The Golden Notebook, published in 1962. A common theme threading through her oeuvre, as Lessing herself noted in her 1994 autobiography, Walking in the Shade, is a rejection of the human condition, which means to be trapped by circumstances.Nowhere did she probe the dark contradictions of the human condition more deeply than in The Fifth Child, a short novel about Ben Lovatt, a Neanderthal-like genetic throwback born to normal parents in modern-day England. Ben is marked as an outcast from the day of his birth because of his monstrous appearance. He did not look like a baby at all. He had a heavy-shouldered hunched look, as if he were crouching there as he lay. His forehead sloped from his eyebrows to his crown. Then there is the matter of Ben's equally bestial behavior. He terrorizes siblings and kills family pets. He is automatically assumed to be a demon seed and a scourge to society. Although slight, the novel was a taut springboard for Lessing's most pressing concerns\u0097the insurmountable differences between men and women, the bind between the individual and greater society, and how society both celebrates and castigates the other. In Ben, in the World, Lessing again takes up the narrative of Ben's life and unsentimentally depicts his education in the ways of the wider world. At 18 he has grown into a werewolf of sorts, hirsute and homeless, renounced by his family. He barks when happy, grunts when annoyed, and dines on small birds. Gainful employment, let alone romance, has proven a challenge. Ironically, Ben winds up with more caretakers as an adult, including Rita, a prostitute who thrills to his animal ways in bed. But although she means well, Rita is the first in a series of people who manipulate Ben for selfish purposes. Construction foremen rely on him for heavy lifting, then cheat him out of his wages; Rita's pimp gives him money and then uses him to smuggle dope to France; a fledgling filmmaker drags Ben into a movie about prehistoric creatures, then cruelly promises to reunite him with similar-looking people. By the novel's end, Ben predictably flees a group of frenzied scientists. Lessing's genius here is to embody the otherness of Ben's point of view without condescending to him. In unadorned prose, she dramatizes Ben as he wrestles with his animal nature, his need to inflict harm as well as his desire to repress that impulse. In his travels, she writes, Ben looked hard at faces for that surprised stare that might turn out to be dangerous.Ben's humanity stands out in sharp relief. Like his caretakers, who congratulate themselves on shepherding him through the world, Ben gets lonely and hungry, and he misses his family. In the end, like them, he commits desperate acts because he feels the sorrow of consciousness, the knowledge of his aloneness.In The Fifth Child, Ben, like the monster of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, reflects the hubris of his creators; in this sequel he becomes, like Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan, a perpetual exile. And as with Burroughs's apeman, Ben's tragedy is that his caretakers are too busy exploiting him to realize they can learn from his predicament. Thanks to Lessing's deep understanding of Ben's world, however, it will be difficult for readers to make a similar oversight.\u0097John Freeman\n\n\nAbout the Author\nDoris Lessing was born to British parents in Persia in 1919 and moved with her family to Southern Rhodesia when she was five years old.

Murrow\u2019s groundbreaking radio broadcasts from 1939 to 1941 brought the blitz into America\u2019s living rooms. Countering the tide of U.S. isolationism, Murrow told his huge audience that the United States could not avoid a confrontation with Hitler and that the bombs it heard falling during his reports would eventually be targeted at American cities. But although often cited as the paragon of journalistic objectivity, Murrow had a clear agenda\u2014to bring America into the war\u2014and he slanted his broadcasts accordingly. And behind the scenes, he helped the British court U.S. public opinion and secure American funds for a British intelligence operation. Broadcasts from the Blitz examines Murrow\u2019s work and life during this crucial time. It also profiles unsung heroes of those days, such as U.S. ambassador John Winant and Winston Churchill\u2019s confidant Brendan Bracken, and villains as well\u2014such defeatists as Joseph Kennedy and Charles Lindbergh, who believed England was doomed. Other compelling characters include Eric Sevareid, Mollie Painter-Downs, and Nancy Astor, whose \u201cCliveden set\u201d was accused of being too cozy with the Germans. They and many others mixed in a London that remained vibrant even as it was being battered. Broadcasts from the Blitz is a story of courage\u2014of a journalist broadcasting live from London rooftops as bombs fell around him\u2014and of intrigue, as the machinery of two governments pulled America and Britain together in a common cause. Finally there is the drama of December 7, 1941, when Murrow was the sole journalist to meet with Roosevelt.

Paul DuBois and his editors at New Riders have assembled MySQL with a clarity and lucidity that inspires confidence in the subject matter: a (nearly) freely redistributable SQL-interpreting database client/server primarily geared for Unix systems but maintained for Windows platforms as well. What isn't free about MySQL (the application) is its server's commercial use; all clients and noncommercial server use are free. DuBois's tome isn't free either, but its list price is modest in light of its value and the value of its namesake. The volume is superbly organized into 12 chapters and 10 appendices and contains a concise table of contents and a comprehensive 50-page index. It is peppered with references to the online HTML documentation that comes with the source and binary distributions (which are available and easy to install in stable rpm and tar releases.) The first third of MySQL is an excellent instruction tool for database newbies; the second third is a detailed reference for MySQL developers; and the last third consists of clearly annotated appendices, including C, Perl (but not Python), and PHP interfaces.  Perhaps as an indication of the collective will of the developers of MySQL, DuBois does not separate Windows 95/98/NT design or development specifics from its main discussions. Platform-independent design is a goal, not a reality, and users will have to rely on newsgroups and mailing lists for details. Moreover, security issues are addressed in a mere 18 pages, a large part of which is devoted to standard Unix file and network-access permissions. Next to nothing is mentioned about defense against common hacking strategies, the use of secure shell interfaces, or access encryption. Although it is nearly 800 pages in length, DuBois's book is thankfully not encyclopedic. It is a valuable pr\u00e9cis of the MySQL database, and its easy-to-skim look and feel will make it an excellent browse for database experts who want to know what is and is not possible within MySQL, the application. --Peter Leopold", "genre": ["Programming", "Technology", "Nonfiction", "Technical", "Reference", "Computers", "Software"], "author": "Paul DuBois", "rating": "3.91", "pages": "1118"}, {"id": 310632, "title": "Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object Orientated Software", "blurb": "Design Patterns is a modern classic in the literature of object-oriented development, offering timeless and elegant solutions to common problems in software design.

In The Believers, first published in 1957, she continues her series about the settling of Kentucky with a moving story of love and marriage set in a Shaker community.Rebecca Fowler is only seventeen when she marries Richard Cooper. She cannot remember a time when she has not loved and trusted him and followed where he led. At first the marriage is happy; it is only after their child is stillborn that Richard shows preliminary signs of religious fanaticism in his insistence that this is God's punishment visited upon them. The Shaker missionaries newly arrived in Kentucky find him an easy convert.When Richard joins the Shaker community, Rebecca goes with him, as a dutiful wife should, hoping that her love will ultimately win him back to her and to the larger world. She becomes part of a strange world in which men and women -- even husbands and wives -- live apart, coming together only for meals and for worship. As time passes and she sees Richard's affection recede, only her stubborn honesty gives her the strength to deny lip service to a doctrine she cannot truly accept and, at the last, courage to follow the dictates of her heart.In this novel, Mrs. Giles gives us a unique picture of everyday life in a Shaker village, one of the experiments in utopian communal living that are a part of American history.

The beautiful young must find a way to restore herself and her aunt to respectability, preferably without accepting either of two repugnant offers. One is from an older, very rich and rather corpulent lord whose reputation for licentious behavior disgusts her; the other from the young, puppyish scion of a noble family whose relatives are convinced she is a fortune hunter.Lady Mablethorpe was aghast. Her young son, Adrian wanted to get married Miss Deborah Grantham--a gambling-club wench! Thus she sent her trusted nephew, the vastly wealthy, clever, and imperturbable Max Ravenscar, speeding to the faro tables to buy the hussy off. A renowned gamester, and the first to own that he is untroubled by a romantic disposition, Ravenscar regards all eligible females with indifference, preferring horses, cockfighting or cards.To Ravenscar's surprise, Deb turned out to be besides remarkably handsome, witty, and--he could scarcely believe it--well-bred. Nevertheless, he expected she'd be grateful far the price he offered to give up her young suitor. Arrogant Ravenscar always gets his way and comes to buy her off, an insult so scathing that it leads to a volley of passionate reprisals, escalating between them to a level of flair and fury that can only have one conclusion. As they lock horns, they become increasingly drawn to each other. Amidst all the misunderstandings and entanglements, has Ravenscar finally met his match?", "genre": ["Romance", "Historical Fiction", "Regency", "Historical Romance", "Historical", "Fiction", "Regency Romance"], "author": "Georgette Heyer", "rating": "3.95", "pages": "217"}, {"id": 311501, "title": "You Wouldn't Want to Be an Assyrian Soldier!: An Ancient Army You'd Rather Not Join", "blurb": "- Humorous Handy Hints that relate directly to the text are provided on each spread.- High interest topic for children of all ages.- Includes Table of Contents, glossary, and index.- Draws in even the most reluctant reader with a lighthearted tone and hilarious illustrations.- The cultures and traditions of ancient civilizations spring to life in the pages of this series.-\n- Humorous Handy Hints that relate directly to the text are provided on each spread.- High interest topic for children of all ages.- Includes Table of Contents, glossary, and index.- Draws in even the most reluctant reader with a lighthearted tone and hilarious illustrations.- The cultures and traditions of ancient civilizations spring to life in the pages of this series.- Perfect for struggling readers.Grades K-4 Social Studies: II.

The tormentor is Jerry Whitman Jr., who runs a successful extortion ring at school and basically makes life difficult for everyone. Alex is known as The Savior for his habit of helping out his fellow losers and fending off Jerry and the boys.  Alex and his two best friends, Winston and Manny, spend a lot of time scheming how they and the other losers might defeat Jerry and his gang in an upcoming challenge.

Politics Out of History is animated by the question of how we navigate the contemporary political landscape when the traditional compass points of modernity have all but disappeared. Wendy Brown diagnoses a range of contemporary political tendencies--from moralistic high-handedness to low-lying political despair in politics, from the difficulty of formulating political alternatives to reproaches against theory in intellectual life--as the consequence of this disorientation. Politics Out of History also presents a provocative argument for a new approach to thinking about history--one that forsakes the idea that history has a purpose and treats it instead as a way of illuminating openings in the present by, for example, identifying the haunting and constraining effects of past injustices unresolved. Brown also argues for a revitalized relationship between intellectual and political life, one that cultivates the autonomy of each while promoting their interlocutory potential. This book will be essential reading for all who find the trajectories of contemporary liberal democracies bewildering and are willing to engage readings of a range of thinkers--Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin, Derrida--to rethink democratic possibility in our time.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Philosophy", "Theory", "Philosophy", "Politics", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Wendy Brown", "rating": "4.11", "pages": "208"}, {"id": 311916, "title": "A Presumption of Death", "blurb": "While Lord Peter is abroad on a secret mission, Harriet Vane, now Lady Peter Wimsey, takes their children to safety in the country.

In so doing, the book presents an alternative to the two most prevalent approaches in aesthetics: the metaphysical mimetic theory pioneered by Plato and Aristotle and the transcendental theory of aesthetic reception pioneered by Hume and Kant and followed by most contemporary theorists. Unlike these two approaches, Stylistics pays due heed to the individuality and unity of meaning and configuration basic to artistic phenomena, making possible a rigorous differentiation of particular forms of artistic style. Because the resulting analysis of style never loses sight of the self-understanding that art provides, Stylistics provides powerful tools for reinterpreting the cultural differences of antiquity and modernity and of East and West.", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Richard Dien Winfield", "rating": "3.00", "pages": "148"}, {"id": 312120, "title": "The Dead Don't Lie", "blurb": "The Dead Don't Lie is the latest in Edgar Award winner and MWA's Grand Master Stuart Kaminsky's Abe Lieberman mystery series.

To what degree can animals communicate within their ownspecies and even between species? What evolutionary purpose do such communications \nEver since Darwin, animal behavior has intrigued and perplexed human observers. The elaborate mating rituals, lavish decorative displays, complex songs, calls, dances and many other forms of animal signaling raise fascinating questions. To what degree can animals communicate within their ownspecies and even between species? What evolutionary purpose do such communications serve? Perhaps most importantly, what can animal signaling tell us about our own non-verbal forms of communication? In The Handicap Principle, Amotz and Ashivag Zahavi offer a unifying theory that brilliantlyexplains many previously baffling aspects of animal signaling and holds up a mirror in which ordinary human behaviors take on surprising new significance. The wide-ranging implications of the Zahavis' new theory make it arguably the most important advance in animal behavior in decades. Based on 20 years of painstaking observation, the Handicap Principle illuminates an astonishing variety of signaling behaviors in animals ranging from ants and amebato peacocks and gazelles. Essentially, the theory asserts that for animal signals to be effective they must be reliable, and to be reliable they must impose a cost, or handicap, on the signaler. When a gazelle sights a wolf, for instance, and jumps high into the air several times before fleeing, it is signaling, in a reliable way, that it is in tip-top condition, easily able to outrun the wolf. (A human parallel occurs in children's games of tag, where faster children will often taunt their pursuer before running). By momentarily handicapping itself--expending precious time and energy inthis display--the gazelle underscores the truthfulness of its signal. Such signaling, the authors suggest, serves the interests of both predator and prey, sparing each the exhaustion of a pointless chase. Similarly, the enormous cost a peacock incurs by carrying its elaborate and weightytail-feathers, which interfere with food gathering, reliably communicates its value as a mate able to provide for its offspring. Perhaps the book's most important application of the Handicap Principle is to the evolutionary enigma of animal altruism. The authors convincingly demonstrate that whenan animal acts altruistically, it handicaps itself--assumes a risk or endures a sacrifice--not primarily to benefit its kin or social group but to increase its own prestige within the group and thus signal its status as a partner or rival. Finally, the Zahavis' show how many forms of non-verbalcommunication among humans can also be explained by the Handicap Principle. Indeed, the authors suggest that non-verbal signals--tones of voice, facial expressions, body postures--are quite often more reliable indicators of our intentions than is language. Elegantly written, exhaustively researched, and consistently enlivened by equal measures of insight and example, The Handicap Principle illuminates virtually every kind of animal communication. It not only allows us to hear what animals are saying to each other--and to understand why they aresaying it--but also to see the enormously important role non-verbal behavior plays in human communication\n...more", "genre": ["Biology", "Evolution", "Science", "Biology", "Science", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Science", "Popular Science"], "author": "Amots Zehavi", "rating": "4.36", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 312737, "title": "Edmund Husserl's \"Origin of Geometry\": An Introduction", "blurb": "Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction (1962) is Jacques Derrida's earliest published work.

Another recounts the pervasive fear of marauding Russian and Czech bandits raping and killing. Children recall fathers who were only photographs and mothers who were saviors and heroes. These are typical in the stories collected in The War of Our Childhood: Memories of World War II. For this book Wolfgang W. E. Samuel, a childhood refugee himself after the fall of Nazi Germany, interviewed twenty-seven men and women who as children--by chance and sheer resilience--survived Allied bombs, invading armies, hunger, and chaos. Our eyes carried no hate, only recognition of what was, Samuel writes of his childhood. Peace was an abstraction. The world we Kinder knew nearly always had the word war appended to it. Samuel's heartfelt narratives from these innocent survivors are invariably riveting and often terrifying. Each engrossing story has perilous and tragic moments--school children in Leuna who are sent home during an air raid but are strafed as moving targets; fathers who exist only as distant figures, returning to their families long after the war--or not at all; mothers who are raped and tortured; families who are forced into a seemingly endless relocation that replicates the terrors of war itself. In capturing such experiences from nearly every region of Germany and involving people of every socio-economic class, this is a collection of unique memories, but each account contributes to a cumulative understanding of the war that is more personal than strategic surveys and histories. For Samuel and the survivors he interviewed, agony and fright were part of everyday life, just as were play, wondrous experience, and above all perseverance. My focus, Samuel writes, is on the astounding ability of a generation of German children to emerge from debilitating circumstances as sane and productive human beings. Wolfgang W. E.
