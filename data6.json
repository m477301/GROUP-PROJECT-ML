[{"id": 2000002, "title": "Landnahme", "blurb": "Er war einer von uns, auch wenn er nur ein Vertriebener war. Bevor sein bester Freund das \u00fcber ihn sagen kann, muss Bernhard Haber mit vielen Anfeindungen fertig werden und bei seiner Landnahme den schmalen Grat zwischen Anpassung und Aufbegehren ertasten. Auf Bernhard, vertrieben aus Wroclaw, aber geboren in Breslau, und seine Eltern hat in dem s\u00e4chsischen St\u00e4dtchen Guldenberg niemand gewartet. Denn sie kommen aus einem Deutschland, das nicht unser Deutschland war, sind ein lebendes Mahnmal f\u00fcr den verlorenen Krieg. Der robuste Junge verschafft sich jedoch schnell Respekt, will stets mit dem Kopf durch die Wand, die die Einheimischen zwischen sich und den Fremden ziehen. In der DDR-Provinz, wo die entz\u00fcckenden Blumenbeete... mit Depressionen ged\u00fcngt werden, wechselt er behende die Besch\u00e4ftigungen und die politischen Lager. Erst hilft er bei der Zwangskollektivierung die Bauern kirre zu machen, dann scheffelt er als Fluchthelfer das gro\u00dfe Geld und baut sich damit eine b\u00fcrgerliche Existenz auf -- ein Selfmademan wie Willenbrock, ein unangepasster Opportunist wie Der Tangospieler. Erz\u00e4hlt wird seine Geschichte von denen, die Bernhard gekannt haben und hier \u00e4hnlich wie Zeugen bei Gericht Auskunft geben: der Banknachbar, seine erste Freundin, der Fluchthelfer-Komplize, seine Schw\u00e4gerin. So entsteht ein Geflecht von Lebensberichten und -beichten, ein Sittenbild der ostdeutschen Nachkriegsgesellschaft, mit allen erdenklichen erotischen, \u00f6konomischen und kriminellen Verwicklungen. Was leicht zur lehrbuchartigen Versuchsanordnung h\u00e4tte geraten k\u00f6nnen, liest sich dank des st\u00e4ndigen Perspektivenwechsels und der erstklassigen Dialoge ausgesprochen unterhaltsam, quasi wie Short Cuts in Sachsen. Am Schluss sorgen die Kinder der Vertriebenen daf\u00fcr, dass im Karnevalsumzug keine Fidschis mitmarschieren, die Landnahme scheint vollends gegl\u00fcckt.

By exposing the fragility of evolutionary theory, and the real harm it has had for society and the Church, Dr. Morris gives pause to those who believe evolution and Christianity can co-exist. For over six decades, Dr. Morris has explored the evil fruits of evolution. In Defending the Faith, he shows Christians the danger in compromising with a philosophy so contrary to the love of God. Dr. Morris's unique ability to puncture evolutionary fallacies, and show the relevance to Christians is on display once again.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Theology"], "author": "Henry M.

A photographer, artist, writer and designer for more than fifty years, he was at the center of the worlds of fashion, society, theater and film. The Unexpurgated Beaton brings together for the first time the never-before-published diaries from 1970 to 1980 and, unlike the six slim volumes of diaries published during his lifetime, these have been left uniquely unedited. Hugo Vickers, the executor of Beaton\u2019s estate and the author of his acclaimed biography, has added extensive and fascinating notes that are as lively as the diary entries themselves. As one London reviewer wrote, \u201cVickers\u2019 waspish footnotes are the salt on the side of the dish.\u201d Beaton treated his other published diaries like his photographs, endlessly retouching them, but, for this volume, Vickers went back to the original manuscripts to find the unedited diaries. Here is the photographer for British and American Vogue, designer of the sets and costumes for the play and film My Fair Lady and the film Gigi, with a cast of characters from many worlds: Bianca Jagger, Greta Garbo, David Hockney, Truman Capote, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, Mae West, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlene Dietrich, Rose Kennedy and assorted Rothschilds, Phippses and Wrightsmans; in New York, San Francisco, Palm Beach, Rio and Greece, on the Amalfi coast; at shooting parties in the English countryside, on yachts, at garden parties at Buckingham Palace, at costume balls in Venice, Paris or London. Beaton had started as an outsider and \u201cdeveloped the power to observe, first with his nose pressed up against the glass,\u201d and then later from within inner circles. Vickers has said, \u201chis eagle eye missed nothing,\u201d and his diaries are intuitive, malicious (he took a \u201crelish in hating certain figures\u201d), praising and awestruck.

Why? Your situation is different.Instead of focusing on what exceptional leaders do, we need to understand and emulate how they think. Successful businesspeople engage in what Martin calls integrative thinking creatively resolving the tension in opposing models by forming entirely new and superior ones. Drawing on stories of leaders as diverse as AG Lafley of Procter & Gamble, Meg Whitman of eBay, Victoria Hale of the Institute for One World Health, and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys, Martin shows how integrative thinkers are relentlessly diagnosing and synthesizing by asking probing questions including: What are the causal relationships at work here? and What are the implied trade-offs?Martin also presents a model for strengthening your integrative thinking skills by drawing on different kinds of knowledge including conceptual and experiential knowledge.Integrative thinking can be learned, and The Opposable Mind helps you master this vital skill.\n...more", "genre": ["Business", "Leadership", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Business", "Management", "Self Help", "Self Help", "Personal Development", "Economics", "Business", "Entrepreneurship", "Design"], "author": "Roger L.

She argues that far from being on the periphery of developments in the early modern period, Qing China both participated in and helped shape the new emphasis on empirical scientific knowledge that was simultaneously transforming Europe\u2014and its colonial empires\u2014at the time. Although mapping in China is almost as old as Chinese civilization itself, the Qing insistence on accurate scale maps of their territory was a new response to the difficulties of administering a vast and growing empire. Likewise, direct observation became increasingly important to Qing ethnographic writings, such as the illustrated manuscripts known as Miao albums (from which twenty color paintings are reproduced in this book). These were intended to educate Qing officials about various non-Han peoples so they could govern these groups more effectively.

As a sociological fieldworker, she began her research during the late 1980s, before any kind of a public queer identity existed in that country. After a decade of conducting interviews, as well as observing and analyzing plays, books, pop music, and graffiti, Essig presents the first sustained study of how and why there was no Soviet gay community or even gay identity before perestroika and the degree to which this situation has\u2014or has not\u2014changed.\tWhile male homosexual acts were criminalized in Russia before 1993, women attracted to women were policed by the medical community, who saw them less as criminals than as diseased persons potentially cured by drug therapy or transsexual surgery. After describing accounts of pre-perestroika persecution, Essig examines the more recent state of sexual identities in Russia. Although the fall of communism brought new freedom to Russian queers, there are still no signs of a mass movement forming around the issue, and few identify themselves as lesbians or gay men, even when they are involved in same-sex relations. Essig does reveal, however, vibrant manifestations of gay life found at the local level\u2014in restaurants, discos, clubs, and cruising strips, in newspapers, journals, literature, and the theater. Concluding with a powerful exploration of the surprising affinities between some of Russia\u2019s most prominent nationalists and its queers, Queer in Russia fills a gap in both Russian and cultural studies. \n...more", "genre": ["LGBT", "Queer", "Nonfiction", "LGBT", "Cultural", "Russia"], "author": "Laurie Essig", "rating": "3.75", "pages": "272"}, {"id": 2003067, "title": "The Virgin Goddess: Studies in the Pagan and Christian Roots of Mariology", "blurb": "The contemporary search for the feminine face of God is requiring a re-examination of the relationship of Christianity to the pagan world in which it came to birth.

Chapter by chapter he seeks to establish his conclusion that 'in Mariology the Christian genius preserved and transformed some of the best and noblest ideas that paganism developed.

The Chronicles follow the intrigues of ambition and love in the cathedral town of Barchester. Trollope was of course interested in the Church, that pillar of Victorian society - in its susceptibility to corruption, hypocrisy, and blinkered conservatism - but the Barsetshire novels are no more 'ecclesiastical' than his Palliser novels are 'political'. It is the behaviour of the individuals within a power structure that interests him. In this novel, Trollope continues the story of Mr Harding and his daughter Eleanor, adding to his cast of characters that oily symbol of progress Mr Slope, the hen-pecked Dr Proudie, and the amiable and breezy Stanhope family. The central questions of this moral comedy - who will be warden? Who will be dean? Who will marry Eleanor? - are skilfully handled with that subtlety of ironic observation that has won Trollope such a wide and appreciative readership.Miss Mackenzie: In 'Miss Mackenzie' Trollope made a deliberate attempt 'to prove that a novel may be produced without any love', but as he candidly admits in his 'Autobiography, the attempt 'breaks down before the conclusion.In taking for his heroine an middle - aged spinster, his contemporaries of writing about young girls in love.

On May 10, 1996, nine climbers perished in a blizzard high on Mount Everest, the single deadliest day ever on the peak. The following day, one of those victims was given a second chance. His name was Beck Weathers.The tale of Dr. Seaborn Beck Weathers's miraculous awakening from a deep hypothermic coma was widely reported. But the hidden story of what led the pathologist to Everest in the first place, and his painful recovery after his dramatic rescue, has not been told until now.  Brilliant and gregarious, Weathers discovered in his thirties that mountain climbing helped him cope with the black dog of depression that had shadowed him since college. But the self-prescribed therapy came at a steep cost: estrangement from his wife, Peach, and their two children. By the time he embarked for Everest, his home life had all but disintegrated. Yet when he was reported dead after lying exposed on the mountain for eighteen hours in subzero weather, it was Peach who orchestrated the daring rescue that brought her husband home. Only then, facing months of surgery and the loss of his hands, did Beck Weathers also begin to face himself, his family, his past and uncertain future.

Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) unquestionably belongs in this elite group. Anyone who has looked in amazement at the Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, or the many drawings that sprang from his fertile imagination may wonder how he accomplished these astounding works of art. Fortunately for posterity, Leonardo left his Treatise on Painting, essentially a primer for students interested in learning the craft of drawing and painting.Even a quick perusal of this multifaceted work will reveal the great artist's famously keen powers of observation and his scientific approach to the study of nature. He begins with careful instructions on drawing the main features of human anatomy, then moves on to techniques of rendering motion and perspective. He discusses aspects of good composition; inventiveness; the expression of various emotions; creating effects of light, shadow, and color; and many other subtle points of artistic composition. Throughout Leonardo stresses the importance of meticulous study of the subjects to be rendered and the need for assiduous practice: Those who become enamored of the practice of the art without having previously applied to the diligent study of the scientific part of it may be compared to mariners who put to sea in a ship without rudder or compass, and therefore cannot be certain of arriving at the wished-for port.This outstanding edition - complete with anatomical drawings by the French classicist master Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) and geometrical illustrations by the great Italian Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472), as well as an informative life of Leonardo and an appendix that lists the artist's manuscripts, principal paintings, and drawings - will make an attractive addition to the libraries of art students, art historians, and anyone interested in the works of the original Renaissance man", "genre": ["Art", "Nonfiction", "Art History", "Classics", "History"], "author": "Leonardo da Vinci", "rating": "4.10", "pages": "364"}, {"id": 2008583, "title": "Ireland", "blurb": "Ireland is a country, which is uniquely associated with a single green color - green.

Enjoy this Q&A--as well as a personal note to Amazon readers--from John Grisham.  1. Your new novel starts off where most courtroom dramas end--with the verdict. Where did you get the idea to reverse the usual order of events this time around? The actual trial is not a terribly significant part of the story. Most all of the action and intrigue begins after the trial is over, with the verdict and the subsequent appeal.  2. The Appeal overtly suggests that elected judges can be bought. If the novel is meant as a cautionary tale, what's next--the Presidential primaries? Why not? Over one billion dollars will be spent next year in the Presidential primaries and general election. With that kind of money floating around, anything can be bought.  3. Speaking of electoral politics, you've been more vocal recently about your political views ... first supporting Jim Webb for Senate and now endorsing Hillary Clinton for the White House. Have you given any thought to running for office yourself? No. I made that mistake 25 years ago, and promised myself I would never do it again. I enjoy watching and participating in politics from the sidelines, but it's best to keep some distance.  4. This is your first legal thriller in three years. How did it feel to get back to the genre that started it all, and can fans expect another thriller from you next year? I still enjoy writing the legal thrillers, and don't plan to get too far away from them. Obviously, they have been very good to me, and they remain popular. I plan to write one a year for the next several years.  5. Your nonfiction book The Innocent Man continues to be a bestseller in paperback. In your ongoing work with The Innocence Project, have you come across another story of the wrongfully convicted that begs to be written as nonfiction? There are literally hundreds of great stories out there about wrongfully convicted defendants. I am continually astounded by these stories, and I resist the temptation to take the plunge again into non-fiction.  6. What's on your bedside reading list at the moment? 1.

Anodea Judith addresses these and many other issues, using the same proven meditations, visualizations, and moving postures taught in her acclaimed chakra seminars. Even for people who have studied the chakra system for years, one question often remains: How do I actually work with the chakras to assist in healing? With The Chakra System, Anodea Judith responds with the first guided audio learning course on chakra work - the ultimate curriculum for tapping the hidden energy matrix of the body.", "genre": ["Spirituality", "Health", "Nonfiction", "Self Help"], "author": "Anodea Judith", "rating": "4.36", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 2009716, "title": "Artefactos", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Poetry"], "author": "Nicanor Parra", "rating": "4.38", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 2009719, "title": "Sermones y pr\u00e9dicas del Cristo de Elqui", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Poetry"], "author": "Nicanor Parra", "rating": "4.22", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 2009830, "title": "Trilogy of Death: Unsuitable Job For A Woman / Innocent Blood / The Skull Beneath the Skin", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Crime", "Detective"], "author": "P.D.

Ask your incoming students what 'management' is, and they'll talk about the kind of management they know from their own work experience. Managers assign people their hours, they give raises or promotions, they tell people what job to do-the manager, in other words, is 'the boss'. In most other work settings, however, management means something far more important and complex. In addition to people, managers also manage performance, processes, relationships, and more increasingly in today's world, deal with the pressure and flux of constant change.This, coupled with the fact that workplaces have steadily become less hierarchical and more team - and group-driven, means the traditional responsibilities of the manager have gradually been dispersed throughout the organization. Students preparing to work in today's business environment may not start in a corner office with an assistant, but they still need to think like managers and understand the strategic goals of the organization. Management, 2nd Edition, prepares your students to join a new kind of workplace, one where management is everyone's business and provides many in-text and CD-ROM applications to emphasize this approach.", "genre": ["Management"], "author": "Luis R.

At the dawn of the 21st millennium the world is still experiencing these anxieties, as seen by the onslaught of fantasies of renewal, doomsday predictions, and New Age prophecies.This fascinating book explores the millenarianism that flourished in western Europe between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries. Covering the full range of revolutionary and anarchic sects and movements in medieval Europe, Cohn demonstrates how prophecies of a final struggle between the hosts of Christ and Antichrist melded with the rootless poor's desire to improve their own material conditions, resulting in a flourishing of millenarian fantasies. The only overall study of medieval millenarian movements, The Pursuit of the Millennium offers an excellent interpretation of how, again and again, in situations of anxiety and unrest, traditional beliefs come to serve as vehicles for social aspirations and animosities.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Religion", "Nonfiction", "Historical", "Medieval", "Religion", "Christianity", "History", "Medieval History", "Philosophy", "Politics", "History", "European History", "Cultural"], "author": "Norman Cohn", "rating": "4.27", "pages": "416"}, {"id": 2010035, "title": "Post-Impressionism", "blurb": "What happened after Impressionism?

Drawing on concepts from social and cultural history, she shows how champagne helped fuel the revolution in consumption as social groups searched for new ways to develop cohesion and to establish status. By the end of the nineteenth century, Guy concludes, the champagne-producing provinces in the department of Marne had developed a rhetoric of French identity that promoted its own marketing success as national. This ability to mask local interests as national concerns convinced government officials of the need, at both national and international levels, to protect champagne as a French patrimony.", "genre": ["Wine", "Food"], "author": "Kolleen M.

My ethnic heritage and participation in the folk arts, education in the social sciences and history, work experience in the Homestead Steel Works, computer graphics and art. In 1991 I was introduced to some people involved in the Centennial Celebration of the 1892 Homestead Steel Strike. I joined the committee to help plan the event and in so doing began the germ of the idea for the book. Historians were writing histories of the strike, producers were making videos of the history but there seemed to be something missing. What was missing was a celebration of the people that were involved in the strike and their descendants. They came from various ethnic backgrounds and settled at various times through the history of Homestead and the steel mill. Having been involved in the folk arts since childhood I also knew that as heritage was passed from generation to generation the folk elements became diluted. The dress or costumes were the first to go, next the language, then the songs and dances. What remained was the food. Passed from generation to generation as grandmothers worked with their daughters and granddaughters cooking holiday traditional recipes and Sunday dinners. A cookbook, I decided, was the perfect media for the celebration of the people of Homestead and surrounding communities that composed the Steel Valley on the Monongahela River. The format of the book was important if it was to have meaning. I decided that history would be the uniting thread throughout the book but not the purpose of it. World, U.S. and local history would tie the elements together. We researched the local newspapers through local libraries and area newspapers. We found recipes that dated back to 1700's as well as household tips and home remedies for ailments. We interviewed people from the major ethnic groups that populated the Homestead vicinity and talked a lot of people into sharing their precious family recipes with us. In short they shared their life's experiences with us. It was also important not to take a position revolving around the politics of the strike but instead to celebrate the people involved in this titanic labor struggle that would find 12 men killed in the violence of the Homestead Massacre that changed the relationship between management and labor for the next fifty years. And so the book took the shape of an ethno-historic cookbook of all things. Whether by design or accident this formula has proven to be quite popular. We are now in the third printing of the book and have shipped books all over the United States and Canada. We begin the book with a brief history of the strike to provide a setting. Each ethnic section begins with a history of the immigration of that particular group and include some interviews with senior members of the group to provide context of what life was like during the heyday of the mills and follow these with some of their most notable recipes. Mixed into this are some historic recipes from local newspapers and many household tips and home remedies. As a labor of love, I am pleased by the success the book has enjoyed. I hope to do others in the future. Learning about the people of this great nation and where they came from is the best part of all. \n...more", "genre": ["Food and Drink", "Cookbooks"], "author": "Publassist", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "186"}, {"id": 2011735, "title": "Monster Mama", "blurb": "Everyone in town knows that Patrick's mother is a monster--even Patrick.

Today, Java servlets stand poised to take Java to the next level as a Web development language. The main reason is that servlets offer a fast, powerful, portable replacement for CGI scripts.The Java Servlet API, introduced as the first standard extension to Java, provides a generic mechanism to extend the functionality of any kind of server. Servlets are most commonly used, however, to extend Web servers, performing tasks traditionally handled by CGI programs. Web servers that can support servlets include: Apache, Netscape's FastTrack and Enterprise Servers, Microsoft's IIS, O'Reilly's WebSite, and JavaSoft's Java Web Server.The beauty of servlets is that they execute within the Web server's process space and they persist between invocations. This gives servlets tremendous performance benefits over CGI programs. Yet because they're written in Java, servlets are far less likely to crash a Web server than a C-based NSAPI or ISAPI extension. Servlets have full access to the various Java APIs and to third-party component classes, making them ideal for use in communicating with applets, databases, and RMI servers. Plus, servlets are portable between operating systems and between servers -- with servlets you can write once, serve everywhere.Java Servlet Programming covers everything you need to know to write effective servlets and includes numerous examples that you can use as the basis for your own servlets. The book explains the servlet life cycle, showing how you can use servlets to maintain state information effortlessly. It also describes how to serve dynamic Web content, including both HTML pages and multimedia data. Finally, it explores more advanced topics like integrated session tracking, efficient database connectivity using JDBC, applet-servlet communication, inter-servlet communication, and internationalization.\n...more", "genre": ["Computer Science", "Technical", "Computer Science", "Programming", "Reference", "Science", "Technology", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Jason Hunter", "rating": "3.49", "pages": "526"}, {"id": 2011993, "title": "Understanding Iraq: The Whole Sweep of Iraqi History, from Genghis Khan's Mongols to the Ottoman Turks to the British Mandate to the American Occupation", "blurb": "Iraq will continue to be a major issue and involvement for the United States into the foreseeable future says William R.

Embodying a ritual to be performed for the dead, with detailed instructions for the behavior of the disembodied spirit in the Land of the Gods, it served as the most important repository of religious authority for some three thousand years. Chapters were carved on the pyramids of the ancient 5th Dynasty, texts were written in papyrus, and selections were painted on mummy cases well into the Christian Era. In a certain sense it stood behind all Egyptian civilization.In the year 1888 Dr. E. Wallis Budge, then purchasing agent for the British Museum, followed rumors he heard of a spectacular archaeological find in Upper Egypt, and found in an 18th Dynasty tomb near Luxor the largest roll of papyrus I had ever seen, tied with a thick band of papyrus, and in a perfect state of preservation. It was a copy of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, written around 1500 B.C. for Ani, Royal Scribe of Thebes, Overseer of the Granaries of the Lords of Abydos, and Scribe of the Offerings of the Lords of Thebes.The Papyrus of Ani, a full version of the Theban recension, is presented here by Dr. Budge, who later became perhaps the world's most renowned Egyptologist.

From Solvay and the mysteries of the universe, Brooks travels to a basement in Turin to subject himself to repeated shocks in a test of the placebo response. No study has ever been able to definitively show how the placebo effect works, so why has it become\u00a0a pillar of\u00a0medical\u00a0science? Moreover, is 96 percent of the universe missing?

With his usual scrupulous fairness, Aron looks to the major social thinkers to discern how they answered this pressing question.Volume 1 explores three traditions: the French liberal school of political sociology, represented by Montesquieu and Tocqueville; the Comtean tradition, anticipating Durkheim in its deemphasis of the political and its elevation of social unity and consensus; and the Marxists, who posited the struggle between classes and placed their faith in historical necessity.

Important elements of his system are elaborated only in the lectures, especially those given in Berlin during the last decade of his life. The original editors conflated materials from different sources and dates, obscuring the development and logic of Hegel's thought. The Hegel Lectures Series is based on a selection of extant and recently discovered transcripts and manuscripts. The original lecture series are reconstructed so that the structure of Hegel's argument can be followed. Each volume presents an accurate new translation accompanied by an editorial introduction and annotations on the text, which make possible the identification of Hegel's many allusions and sources.Hegel lectured on the proofs of the existence of God as a separate topic in 1829. He also discussed the proofs in the context of his lectures on the philosophy of religion (1821-31), where the different types of proofs were considered mostly in relation to specific religions. The text that he prepared for his lectures in 1829 was a fully formulated manuscript and appears to have been the first draft of a work that he intended to publish and for which he signed a contract shortly before his death in 1831. The 16 lectures include an introduction to the problem of the proofs and a detailed discussion of the cosmological proof. Philipp Marheineke published these lectures in 1832 as an appendix to the lectures on the philosophy of religion, together with an earlier manuscript fragment on the cosmological proof and the treatment of the teleological and ontological proofs as found in the 1831 philosophy of religion lectures.Hegel's 1829 lectures on the proofs are of particular importance because they represent what he actually wrote as distinct from auditors' transcriptions of oral lectures. Moreover, they cone late in his career and offer his final and most seasoned thinking on a topic of obvious significance to him, that of the reality status of God and ways of knowing God. These materials show how Hegel conceived the connection between the cosmological, teleological, and ontological proofs.All of this material has been newly translated by Peter C. Hodgson from the German critical editions by Walter Jaeschke.

No other sacred object has inspired such longing or such dread. The Grail is the archetype of the marvelous object in which each individual can enclose the goal of his own personal quest. For some the goal of this quest has been divine grace or the Philosophers' Stone, for others it is simply a treasure that connects various episodes of the King Arthur legend.Yet the Grail, as an object that is both close and unapproachable, was not the original focus of these stories. The Celtic tales on which the Grail legend is based emphasize the theme of the Quest. Through his exploration of several versions of this myth that appeared in the Middle Ages, Jean Markale digs deep beneath the Christian veneer of these tales, allowing us to penetrate to the true meaning of the Grail and its Quest, legacies of a rich Celtic spirituality that has nourished the Western psyche for centuries.

Timberlake chronicles the intellectual, political, and economic developments that prompted the use of central banking institutions to regulate the monetary systems. After describing the constitutional principles that the Founding Fathers laid down to prevent state and federal governments from printing money. Timberlake shows how the First and Second Banks of the United States gradually assumed the central banking powers that were originally denied them. Drawing on congressional debates, government documents, and other primary sources, he analyses the origins and constitutionality of the greenbacks and examines the evolution of clearinghouse associations as private lenders of last resort. He completes this history with a study of the legislation that fundamentally changed the power and scope of the Federal Reserve System\u2014the Banking Act of 1935 and the Monetary Control Act of 1980. Writing in nontechnical language, Timberlake demystifies two centuries of monetary policy. He concludes that central banking has been largely a series of politically inspired government-serving actions that have burdened the private economy.\n...more", "genre": ["Economics", "History", "Economics", "Finance"], "author": "Richard H.

Howard Singerman's thoughtful study is the first to place that degree in its proper historical framework and ideological context. Arguing that where artists are trained makes a difference in the forms and meanings they produce, he shows how the university, with its disciplined organization of knowledge and demand for language, played a critical role in the production of modernism in the visual arts. Now it is shaping what we call postmodernism: like postmodernist art, the graduate university stresses theory and research over manual skills and traditional techniques of representation.Singerman, who holds an M.F.A. in sculpture as well as a Ph.D. in Visual and Cultural Studies, is interested in the question of the artist as a professional and what that word means for and about the fashioning of artists. He begins by examining the first campus-based art schools in the 1870s and goes on to consider the structuring role of women art educators and women students; the shift from the fine arts to the visual arts; the fundamental grammar of art laid down in the schoolroom; and the development of professional art training in the American university.

And even these were not the limit of his interests, for he also made films, designed scenery and costumes, and excelled in commercial graphics and exhibition design.\n...more", "genre": ["Art"], "author": "Krisztina Passuth", "rating": "4.71", "pages": "446"}, {"id": 2022693, "title": "The Complete Book of Naughty Stories for Good Boys and Girls: All 13 Volumes", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Childrens", "Fiction"], "author": "Christopher  Milne", "rating": "3.69", "pages": "284"}, {"id": 2022732, "title": "Friday", "blurb": "Friday, winner of the 1967 Grand Prix du Roman of the Acad\ufffdmie Fran\ufffdaise, is a sly, enchanting retelling of the legend of Robinson Crusoe by the man the New Yorker calls France's best and probably best-known writer.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's witch-hunts in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.WIth an introduction by Christopher Bigsby.(back cover)", "genre": ["Classics", "Plays", "Fiction", "Historical Fiction", "School", "Drama", "Read For School"], "author": "Arthur  Miller", "rating": "3.60", "pages": "143"}, {"id": 2022918, "title": "I Love Boats", "blurb": "Anchors aweigh and full speed ahead!

First, mercenaries are considered to be immoral because they use force outside legitimate, authoritative control. Second, mercenaries are considered to be morally problematic because they fight wars for selfish, financial reasons as opposed to fighting for some kind of larger conception of the common good.The book examines four puzzles about mercenary use, and argues that they can only be explained by understanding the norm against mercenaries. First, the book argues that moral disapproval of mercenaries led to the disappearance of independent mercenaries from medieval Europe. Second, the transition from armies composed of mercenaries to citizen armies in the nineteenth century can only be understood with attention to the norm against mercenaries. Third, it is impossible to understand why international law regarding mercenaries, created in the 1970s and 1980s, is so ineffective without understanding the norm. Finally, the disappearance of companies like Executive Outcomes and Sandline and the development of today's private security industry cannot be understood without the norm.This book is a project of the Oxford Leverhulme Programme on the Changing Character of War.", "genre": ["History", "Military Fiction", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Sarah Percy", "rating": "3.75", "pages": "272"}, {"id": 2026182, "title": "The Pathless Way", "blurb": "A tour de force, a remarkable narrative of spiritual and political development. . . .

But by the dawn of World War II, its army and air forces had both been rejuvenated to sufficient vigor to conquer most of Europe. As James Corum shows, the Luftwaffe's dramatic resurrection underscored the remarkable success of Germany's visionary interwar planning.A superb example of both military and intellectual history, Corum's study provides a complete and accurate account of the evolution of German military aviation theory, doctrine, war games, and operations between the two world wars. It reveals how the Germans, in defiance of Versailles, thoroughly studied and tested the lessons of World War I, analyzed the emerging air doctrines of other nations, and experimented with innovative aviation technology to create the world's most powerful air force by 1940.Drawing heavily upon archival sources, Corum discloses the debates within the General Staff--led by the likes of Hans van Seeckt, Helmuth Wilberg, Wolfram von Richthofen, and Walter Wever--about the future role of airpower and the problems of aligning aviation technology with air doctrine. He challenges previous accounts and demolishes a number of myths, for example demonstrating that Germany did not dismiss the potential of strategic bombing or embrace terror bombing of civilian populations, and was not heavily influenced by its popular culture's romance with aviation.Corum also illuminates Germany's comprehensive approach to highly mobile combined-arms warfare, its secret research and training in the Soviet Union, and its remarkable successes during the Spanish Civil War.

This is done by examining the writing of intellectuals from preindependence Ghana from the latter half of the nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth, writers who operated self-consciously in a Pan-African ideological framework. By confronting the concept of the African Nation under the colonial order, the book argues, these writer-intellectuals were also confronting modernity in ways that would be important to the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Writing Ghana, Imagining Africa is affiliated with recent revisionary works that have demonstrated the conceptual and existential validity of alternative modernities. This book proposes in this regard to shift our understanding of the modern from a securely and exclusively Western mode of being to the modern as relational and inclusively intercultural. It mobilizes this relational and intercultural conception to locate and outline African modernity. Additionally, Writing Ghana, Imagining Africa demonstrates why and how projections of, and debates about, African modernity have been more than a continental affair. This book locates African modernity at the core of the activist intellection of the internationalist and black Atlantic nationalism of Pan-Africanism. Hence it comprehensively relates the thought of African Americans (Martin Delany, Alexander Crummell, W. E. B. Du Bois, Richard Wright), and West Indians (George Padmore, C.L.R. James), to that of seminal anglophone West African thinkers like E. W. Blyden, Africanus Horton, J. E. Casely Hayford, and Kwame Nkrumah.

This magnificent work--born from a multi-year project that included a museum exhibition, scholarly symposium, and reinstallation of a segment of the permanent collection of the Davis Museum and Cultural Center at Wellesley College--features the work of such renowned artists as Il Pintoricchio, Mantegna, Munch, and L ger, alongside fresh, undiscovered masters and little-known works of art. The book's fifty catalogue entries range from a rare thirteenth-century panel painting to a specially commissioned artwork exploring the intersection of religion and modern life.  This volume investigates everything from non-Western perceptions of European religious practices to the Virgin Mary's voice in musical composition. In the opening essay The Many Names of the Mother of God noted scholar Robert A. Orsi considers why images of Mary offer contemporary Americans such a powerful visual experience. Unlike paintings and sculptures created solely for aesthetic contemplation, Orsi writes, images of Mary are more than just artistic representations--they become for us an embodiment of the Virgin Mother herself. Then, moving into the historical realm, editor Melissa R. Katz guides us on a twenty-century chronological tour that explores the intersection of art history and world history in representations of Mary.  Katz's essay Regarding Mary: Women's Lives Reflected in the Virgin's Image takes the elements of Marian iconography most relevant to the study of art and weaves them together to provide a guide for modern audiences to engage with the religious origins of our common artistic legacy. Filled with fascinating information, this important work requires no particular background in art history, religion, or the Bible.

In addition to some of the most prominent personalities of the day (among them Gerbert of Reims, Lanfranc and Anselm of Bec, Ivo of Chatres, and John of Salisbury), the contributors examine those teachers and students who worked in the shadows: figures like the biblical exegete Richard of Preaux and the musical innovator Theinred of Dover. The focus throughout the volume is on personalities and personal relationships, thus recreating the human connections that lay behind medieval humanism and the Twelfth-Century Renaissance.

In addition, each narrative details the strength of each side, the losses suffered, and the strategic consequences of the battles.The maps are divided into four groups, each of which constitute a chapter in the history of the war: the Amatuer War saw civilian volunteer armies slug it out at Bull Run and Shiloh; the Organized War saw the emergence of managers of war like George B. McClellan (who could administer, but who was loath to fight) as well as the rise of Robert E. Lee; the period of Confederate High Tide in 1863 saw Southern hopes crest only to collapse again after Gettysburg and Vicksburg; and ultimately the era of Total War witnessed the complete metamorphosis of the war from its chivalric beginnings to it emergence as the world's first unlimited war under the leadership of Grant and Sherman.

Instead, during this time Sartre was emerging as one of France\u2019s most promising young novelists and playwrights\u2014he had already published Nausea, The Age of Reason, The Flies, and No Exit. Not content, however, he was meanwhile consciously attempting to revive the form of the essay via detailed examinations of writers who were to become central to European cultural life in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Collected here are Sartre\u2019s experiments in reimagining the idea and structure of the essay. Among the distinguished writers he analyzes are Francis Ponge, Georges Bataille, Vladimir Nabokov, Maurice Blanchot, and, of course, Albert Camus, whose novel The Stranger Sartre endeavours to explain in these pages. Critical Essays (Situations I) also contains a famous attack on the Catholic novelist Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, studies of the great American literary iconoclasts Faulkner and Dos Passos, and brief but insightful essays on aspects of the philosophical writings of Husserl and Descartes. This new translation by Chris Turner reinvigorates the original skill and voice of Sartre\u2019s work and will be essential reading for fans of Sartre and the many writers and works he explores.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor my generation he has always been one of the great intellectual heroes of the twentieth century, a man whose insight and intellectual gifts were at the service of nearly every progressive cause of our time.\u201d\u2014Edward Said\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Philosophy"], "author": "Jean-Paul Sartre", "rating": "3.81", "pages": "314"}, {"id": 2032219, "title": "Trouble mit Jake", "blurb": "Jake finds out he's been betrayed by his old girlfriend, Zoey.

Gongora is comprised of twenty sonnets by the poet, which Pablo Picasso wrote out in hand and further embellished with flourishes, figures and sketches. The artist also rendered twenty portraits to accompany these poems. The result is a blending of word and image, full of imaginary variety and exceptional artistic virtuosity. This bilingual edition of Gongora, featuring a preface by award-winning poet Edward Hirsch and an introduction by former New York Times chief art critic John Russell, presents this intimate union of art and poetry.Gongora's sophisticated and complex poetic style inspired a school of literature, called culteranismo, influenced by his expressive power, unrestrained by the strict conventions of formal Spanish. Known for his sharp wit and self-satire, he was acutely aware of the irony in his passion for women and gambling, and his position as a deacon of the Catholic Church. In Gongora, Picasso's handwritten Spanish text, with its embellishing remarques closely following the words, established the artist's personal attachment to the poetry. The rich presentation of images\u2014described as a veritable feminine kaleidoscope\u2014invites the natural comparison with the great Spanish portraitists Velasquez and El Greco, who were Gongora's contemporaries.This edition of Gongora will appeal to a broad audience and expose a new generation of readers to the lyrical brilliance of this groundbreaking Spanish poet and to the visual interpretation of his famous admirer. Picasso's etchings, executed in drypoint and aquatint, demonstrate an extraordinary ability to master the elements of light and shade to create rich, sensuous and mysterious effects. Perhaps Picasso's finest graphic accomplishment, Gongora is a memorable visual and literary experience. 40 duotone illustrations.\n...more", "genre": ["Poetry", "Art"], "author": "Luis de G\u00f3ngora y Argote", "rating": "4.27", "pages": "176"}, {"id": 2033877, "title": "The Magic City", "blurb": "This is a pre-1923 historical reproduction that was curated for quality.

It is about many things \u2014a town and its people, the author, a certain kind of idyllic life. As much as anything else, it is the biography of the house Vorse bought in 1907 and lived in, off and on, for the next thirty-six years. The moods of the house mirrored her own. Our houses, she wrote, are our biographies, the stories of our defeats and victories. Tinged with nostalgia and disenchantment, the book describes a Provincetown that has changed, a place on the verge of modernity. It is no longer a major fishing port. It has become a place whose business is tourism. Contrasting the old and the new, Vorse celebrates the enduring character of the town itself. She tells stories that are engaging and charming, droll and fabulous. The wrinkled Mrs. Mary Mooncusser who, though drunk and stark naked, conducts herself with great decorum when Vorse pays her a call, might have stepped out of the pages of Sherwood Anderson or Eudora Welty. In another anecdote, the townspeople scour the beaches for cases of booze dumped into the sea by rumrunners and are briefly inflated with the spirit of ancestral smugglers and buccaneers. Vorse herself remained something of an outsider in Provincetown, despite her evident affection for the place and its inhabitants. They surely regarded her as simply another of those artist-intellectuals--many of whom appear in the pages of this book. The off-Cape outsiders put the town in the national limelight but took no interest in local matters. Vorse here ponders local matters exclusively, almost, one suspects, as a way of forgetting the more complex matters that occupied her--her agonies of parental guilt, her resentment of domestic obligations, her third marriage, her depressions and breakdowns.

For centuries, the predominant trend had been for Indians to shed tribal identities in favor of non-Indian ones. Warren argues that many factors\u2014including the reduction of state-sponsored anti-Indian violence, intervention from the Catholic church, and shifts in anthropological thinking about ethnicity\u2014have prompted a reversal of racial aspirations and reimaginings of Indianness. Challenging the current emphasis on blackness in Brazilian antiracist scholarship and activism, Warren demonstrates that Indians in Brazil recognize and oppose racism far more than any other ethnic group. Racial Revolutions fills a number of voids in Latin American scholarship on the politics of race, cultural geography, ethnography, social movements, nation building, and state violence.

Writing out of their particular position in the North American context, African American thinkers have contributed significantly to biblical studies, theology, church history, ethics, sociology of religion, homiletics, pastoral care, and a number of other fields. Frequently the work of these African American scholars is brought together in the seminary curriculum under the rubric of the black church studies class. Drawing on these several disciplines, the black church studies class seeks to give an account of the broad meaning of Christian faith in the African American experience. Up to now, however, there has not been a single, comprehensive textbook designed to meet the needs of students and instructors in these classes. Black Church Studies: An Introduction will meet that need. Drawing on the work of specialists in several fields, it introduces all of the core theological disciplines from an African American standpoint, from African American biblical interpretation to womanist theology and and ethics to sociological understandings of the life of African American churches. It will become an indispensable resource for all those preparing to serve in African American congregations, or to understand African American contributions to the study of Christian faith. Looks at the diverse definitions and functions of the Black Church as well as the ways in which race, class, religion, and gender inform its evolution. Provides a comprehensive view of the contributions of African American Scholarship to the current theological discussion. Written by scholars with broad expertise in a number of subject areas and disciplines. Will enable the reader to relate the work of African American theological scholars to the tasks of preaching, teaching, and leading in local congregations. Will provide the reader the most comprehensive understanding of African American theological scholarship available in one volume.

He was twenty-four, Beth was twenty-three, I was twenty-one, Toph was eight, and all of us were so tried already, from that winter.

We came to California and we wanted everything, would take what was ours, anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I, he with his backward hat and long hair, living together in our little house in Berkeley, would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows.

And then, as in Dorothy's dream, all these people I grew up with were there, too, some of them orphans also, most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary, that it was time to tear or break down, ruin, remake, take and devour.

Thus the public nudity, and this ridiculous magazine, and the Real World tryout, all this need, most of it disguised by sneering, but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window, I guess, a few years when your muscles are taut, coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy?

There is another way to look at history. The rise of widespread, systematic data collection in the twentieth century-the first measured century-allows us to examine the past 100 years with unprecedented clarity. Now, The First Measured Century uses social data to tell us what happened to everyday Americans in the twentieth century. Whether the topic is politics, sexual behavior, economics, immigration, living arrangements, religion, longevity, or public opinion, this myth-busting popular reference work shows that the facts often turn out to be more interesting than the fiction. A special feature of The First Measured Century is original 1999 research that builds on the landmark sociological study of the 1920s, Middletown. With survey results that span more than seven decades, The First Measured Century offers the longest timeline of consistent attitudinal data anywhere. This panorama of the American twentieth century unfolds in a series of key trends, each explained in a one-page essay written for the general reader and illustrated by one or more vibrantly colored charts on the facing page.

Premonitions lead to a sense of unease that is terrifyingly realized.Publisher's WeeklyIn this strong sequel to Rusalka, Cherryh continues her fantasy series based on ancient Russian folklore. During the hoary time of the book's setting, wizards have power to influence events by wishing things to happen--but sometimes unlooked-for side effects occur. Here the former destructive rusalka (ghost) Eveshka, killed by the sorcerer Chernevog in the earlier volume and resurrected when her father sacrificed his life in her stead, is living with her husband Pyetr and the young wizard Sasha. Both Sasha and Eveshka worry about the power of their often unconscious wishes, concerned that their thoughts are being influenced by still-functioning wishes remaining in the atmosphere from a former time. When Eveshka suddenly leaves home without reason, Sasha and Pyetr feel sure someone has been wishing or magicking her, and set out in search of Chernevog. Cherryh's lyrical, vivid depiction of lonely northern forests and their supernatural inhabitants creates a believable backdrop for her three-dimensional characters and their emotionally involving story.Library JournalA young wizard, his best friend, and a woman magically restored to life find their idyllic forest existence shattered by the dark machinations of an old and implacable enemy in this sequel to Rusalka. Forest spirits, yard things, and other magical creatures drawn from Russian folklore add a unique flavor to this story of loyalty and courage.

Over the years she's raised a monkey, a coyote, and a horned toad, and she came within a heartbeat of taking home a wallaby. In this mammoth pet encyclopedia she identifies dozens of unusual and not-so-unusual critters that make great pets in the house, in the yard, and in the wild. Stein even suggests temporary pets kids can bring home to observe overnight and return to their natural habitat the next morning.Stein's recommendations suit every domestic situation. Skunks, for example, work well in an apartment. A big backyard is ideal for keeping a goat or two. If parents don't want a pet running through the house, tarantulas are happy in a nice glass vivarium. And if indoor pets are out of the question, Stein explains how to befriend the pigeons in the park or the rabbits in the yard.For all her enthusiasm, Stein takes a common-sense approach to pets. Each entry discusses diet, housing, special problems, life span, and just how tame you can expect the pet to become. She also tells you whom to call if you wind up with a sick snake or an angry parrot. Stein devotes an entire chapter to which type of vivarium, aquarium, serpentarium, cage, or hutch is best suited to which creature. She even explains how to build an inexpensive-but-comfortable habitat.Whether you like them furry, slithery, slimy, or scaly; whether you want one that swims, crawls, leaps, flies, or hardly moves at all, you'll find a pet in this book suited to every family's taste.", "genre": ["Animals", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Sara Stein", "rating": "4.26", "pages": "368"}, {"id": 2037822, "title": "Il Gran Cardinale: Alessandro Farnese, Patron of the Arts", "blurb": "During much of the sixteenth century, Rome was the artistic centre of the known world, and Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the wealthy and powerful grandson of Pope Paul III, was the city's most important individual patron of the visual arts.

For over fifty years Farnese commissioned buildings and paintings of the highest quality from the major artists active in the city. Using a wealth of hitherto unpublished material, Clare Robertson provides the first thorough reconstruction of Farnese's development and influence as a patron, at the same time, raising important questions about the attitudes and motives of Renaissance patrons and challenging a number of current art-historical assumptions about patronage. She shows how Farnese began his patronage with costly works of decorative art and thus embarked on an extensive campaign of secular commissions from artists such as Titian, Vasari, and Taddeo Zuccaro. His secular patronage culminated with his magnificent villa at Caprarola, designed by Vignola. Only in the 1560s, after some thirty years as a Cardinal, did he turn to commissions for religious works, mainly in response to Counter Reformation pressures and because of his fervent desire to become Pope. The emphasis of his patronage then changed dramatically as he embarked on building an impressive number of new churches, including the Gesu, the most influential church of the late sixteenth century. This handsomely illustrated study of a major artistic figure will be indispensable to students and scholars of sixteenth-century Italy and its art.\n...more", "genre": ["History"], "author": "Clare Robertson", "rating": "5.00", "pages": "323"}, {"id": 2037861, "title": "Bedlam", "blurb": "Conspiracies and paranoia sweep across England in the aftermathof the French Revolution, landing tea broker James Tilly Matthews in BethlemHospital, a notorious, crumbling home for the insane.

In this unique presentation he focuses on the uses of a variety of garden plants--flowering and nonflowering--with which to create enduring garden designs that rescue roses from the stiff formality of most ornamental gardens.

He writes authoritatively on perennials, garden design, the grouping of plants, on groundcovers and much else...Few gardeners are so catholic or such connoisseurs.\u00a0The present book is a glorious display--in words and color illustrations--of Mr. Thomas's gardens, providing an education for the reader in the design of his own garden. \u00a0Photographs show roses close up and in garden settings with complementary plants that extend the flowering season of the gardens into the late fall. The author explores the origins of the roses selected and explains how he has employed their particular qualities in his designs.

To take an example at random, the eight personality articles in the December, 2001, issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology included contributions from the United States, Canada, Germany, Finland, and Israel. For the most part, international personality research is not cross-cultural; it is simply personality research conducted in different countries. The implicit assumption behind this practice is that personality processes are universal, and where they are studied is thus of no consequence. An insensitivity to cul- tural context once imputed mostly to Americans now appears to characterize the field worldwide. Fortunately, recent years have also seen a rise of interest in studies of personality and culture (Church, 2001; Church & Lonner, 1998; Lee, McCauley, & Draguns, 1999; McCrae, 2000). What do these new studies show? Are personality processes indeed universal, or are there significant variations across cultures that necessitate a more nuanced approach to research? There is as yet no definitive answer to that question. In some respects, human personality does seem to transcend the boundaries of language and culture; in other respects, it is profoundly influenced by social and historical forces.

Yet despite efforts to achieve this goal, many individuals continue to suffer with behavior disorders, adjustment difficulties, and low life satisfaction. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a unique psychotherapeutic approach that addresses this issue by altering the very ground on which rational change strategies rest. Within a coherent theoretical and philosophical framework, ACT illuminates the ways clients understand and perpetuate their difficulties through language. The book shows how interventions based on metaphor, paradox, and experiential exercises can enable clients to break free of language traps and make contact with thoughts, feelings, memories, and physical sensations that have been feared and avoided. Detailed guidelines are presented for helping clients recontextualize and accept these private events, develop greater clarity about personal values, and commit to needed behavior change. Providing in one volume a scientifically sound theory of psychopathology and a practical treatment model, and illustrated by a wealth of clinical examples, this is an important resource for practitioners and students in the full range of behavioral health care fields.  \n...more", "genre": ["Psychology", "Nonfiction", "Health", "Mental Health", "Self Help", "Psychology", "Counselling", "Health", "Social Science", "Social Work", "Spirituality", "Science", "Self Help", "Personal Development"], "author": "Steven C.

And I know my wife enjoyed it, too, though they was nothin' said between us at the time.Gullible's Travels, the story from which this book takes its name, has to do with a trip to Palm Beach and was written in 1916. Readers who have never been to Palm Beach and who contemplate going there are warned not to base their budget on figures quoted in the story. In those days you could get a double room with bath at one of the two big hotels for a niggling $17.00 per day. That sum now is just a fair diurnal tip for the house detective. Everything has doubled or trebled in price in the past ten years, and still the influx of eager customers increases. Newspapers continue, from habit, to speak of the place as exclusive, but a person with money who can't crash in there these days would be blackballed from the Rotary club. And for all that, Palm Beach is worth a visit if you are not deaf or blind. The writer was there this winter for only a day, but was repaid for his trouble by the sight of a lady (a prominent society lady, too) in a bathing costume consisting of a big, floppy black silk hat, horn-rimmed spectacles, a black velvet doublet, with choking high collar and long sleeves, black silk tights and black shoes, a black silk umbrella, and WHITE GLOVES.
