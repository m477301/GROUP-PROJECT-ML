Joanne Clarke, the bitter and sad biology teacher who schemes to be John's wife, reviles Valentine to eventual self-destruction. Valentine's best friend, a former figure-skating champion, humiliates her for the crime of being different.But Miriam Kessler -- betrayed and anguished by the husband she once worshipped -- \u2014loves Valentine only the way a mother could -- deeply, yet without knowing. Transposing one sensual appetite for another, Miriam eats and eats and seeks solace in a daily game of mah-jongg with her three girlfriends. The Girls, a cross between a Greek Chorus and a Brooklyn rendition of the Three Wise Men, dispense advice, predictions, and care in the form of extravagant gifts and homemade strudels. When Miriam's greatest fear for Valentine is realized, she takes comfort in the thought that it couldn't get any worse. But then something even stranger happens, and Valentine's mysterious presence becomes an even more mysterious absence.Written in a naturalistic voice that echoes that of the characters, An Almost Perfect Moment is a dark and sharply comic novel about star-crossed lovers, mothers and daughters, doctrines of the divine, and a colorful Jewish community that once defined Brooklyn.

Far from just an account of the various air battles, Professor Overy treats the air war as a complex and fascinating historical web, woven out of grand strategy, economic mobilization, the recruitment of science, and the nature of leadership and training. Analyzing the achievements and failures of the aerial component of the war, he places it in perspective by explaining the role aviation played in the overall conflict. He points out that while the Axis powers tended to limit their use of air power to one major role, such as support of ground forces, the Allies exploited all aspects of aerial doctrine: air defense, strategic bombardment, air-naval cooperation, and ground support. He also demonstrates how aircraft ensured that the Second World War became a people\u2019s war and how success in the air war was, in a very real sense, a test of a nation\u2019s modernity. The air war was won and lost not only in the skies but also in the factories and the research institutes. Finally, the author dispels many popular myths and in particular reveals that although air power in the form of strategic bombing by itself did not deter-mine the war\u2019s final outcome, its use dramatically illustrated the complexities of managing modern war.

He shows rather that new tools are more often the sparks that ignite scientific discovery. Such tool-driven revolutions have profound social consequences--the invention of the telescope turning the Medieval world view upside down, the widespread use of household appliances in the 1950s replacing servants, to cite just two examples. In looking ahead, Dyson suggests that solar energy, genetics, and the Internet will have similarly transformative effects, with the potential to produce a more just and equitable society. Solar power could bring electricity to even the poorest, most remote areas of third world nations, allowing everyone access to the vast stores of information on the Internet and effectively ending the cultural isolation of the poorest countries. Similarly, breakthroughs in genetics may well enable us to give our children healthier lives and grow more efficient crops, thus restoring the economic and human vitality of village cultures devalued and dislocated by the global market.Written with passionate conviction about the ethical uses of science, The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet is both a brilliant reinterpretation of the scientific process and a challenge to use new technologies to close, rather than widen, the gap between rich and poor.\n...more", "genre": ["Science", "Nonfiction", "Science", "Technology", "Philosophy", "Futurism", "Writing", "Essays", "Science", "Popular Science", "Anthropology", "Science", "Physics", "Science", "Biology"], "author": "Freeman Dyson", "rating": "3.80", "pages": "144"}, {"id": 600098, "title": "Oh, Waiter!

Thus it is now possible to show that most of the four hundred seven passages were entered when Jefferson was a young man, between the ages of fifteen and thirty. As such, they reflect the range of his literary interests from his school days to about the time of his marriage and involvement in politics.As one of the few surviving documents from Jefferson's early years, this notebook assumes special importance as a source of insight into the least known period of his life. In the introduction the editor presents reasons for thinking that the commonplace book was more to Jefferson than a literary sampler and was in some respects a deeply personal notebook with direct connections to the emotional events and preoccupations of his formative years. In addition to the text and annotation, the book contains a register of authors and an illustrated essay on Jefferson's handwriting that provides the rationale for assigning approximate dates to the entries of the commonplace book.Originally published in 1989.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts in engineering and computer science.This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information.

This system was focused on the ever-present cycles of the Moon. This concentration was needed for them to determine the months of their lunar-oriented calendar and to determine the dates of festivals. They associated each of the thirteen lunar months with a variety of things, including a tree, a stone, a planet, a character from their myths, and more. Over the years they discovered that people born within the same lunar months of the year had certain similar qualities. This is the information you will find revealed in The Celtic Lunar Zodiac. The knowledge can add insights into your life today, giving you a path for your future growth. The book begins with a brief historical overview and a comparison of the Celtic zodiac with the more familiar Western zodiac. Once you have the basics the book goes into great depth. There is a chapter for each of the lunar months. Each begins with one of the breathtakingly beautiful paintings of Margaret Walty, illustrating some of the symbols associated with the month. Then you will learn the meanings of the planet, the tree, the tree alphabet letter, and the mythic figure associated with that sign. This is completed with a general description of a person born during this period, his or her positive and negative aspects, how the person approaches love and marriage, and more.

More than 100 million email messages are exchanged each day, along with countless files, documents, and audio and video images.Everyone is jumping on the Internet bandwagon. Once a haven for academicians and scientists, the Net is now reaching large and small businesses, government at all levels, school children, and senior citizens. The commercial world is rushing headlong into doing business on the Internet, barely pausing while technologies and policies catch up with their desire to go online. But, too few of the seekers after Internet wisdom and riches consider whether their businesses will be safe on the Net.What kinds of security risks are posed by the Internet? Some risks have been around since the early days of networking -- password attacks (guessing them or cracking them via password dictionaries and cracking programs), denial of service, and exploiting known security holes. Some risks are newer and even more dangerous -- packet sniffers, IP (Internet Protocol) forgery, and various types of hijacking attacks.Firewalls are a very effective way to protect your system from these Internet security threats. Firewalls in computer networks keep damage on one part of the network (e.g., eavesdropping, a worm program, file damage) from spreading to the rest of the network. Without firewalls, network security problems can rage out of control, dragging more and more systems down.What is a firewall? It's a hardware and/or software solution that restricts access from your internal network to the Internet -- and vice versa. A firewall may also be used to separate two or more parts of your local network (for example, protecting finance from R&D). The firewall is installed at the perimeter of the network, ordinarily where it connects to the Internet. You can think of a firewall as a checkpoint; all traffic, incoming and outgoing, is stopped at this point. Because it is, the firewall can make sure that it is acceptable. Acceptable means that whatever is passing through -- email, file transfers, remote logins, NFS mounts, etc. -- conforms to the security policy of the site.Building Internet Firewalls is a practical guide to building firewalls on the Internet. If your site is connected to the Internet, or if you're considering getting connected, you need this book. It describes a variety of firewall approaches and architectures and discusses how you can build packet filtering and proxying solutions at your site. It also contains a full discussion of how to configure Internet services (e.g., FTP, SMTP, Telnet) to work with a firewall. The book also includes a complete list of resources, including the location of many publicly available firewall construction tools.The book is divided into four parts:Part I discusses Internet threats, the benefits of firewalls, overall security strategies, and a summary of Internet services and their security risks.Part II describes possible firewall designs and general terms and concepts, how to protect the bastion host in your firewall configuration, how to build proxying and packet filtering firewalls, and how to configure Internet services to operate with a firewall.Part III describes how to maintain a firewall, develop a security policy, and respond to a security incident.Part IV contains appendices consisting of a resource summary, a directory of how to find firewall toolkits and other security-related tools, and a detailed summary providing TCP/IP background information.\n...more", "genre": ["Computer Science", "Technical", "Science", "Technology", "Science", "Computer Science", "Computer Science", "Computers"], "author": "Elizabeth D.

This riveting, headline-making, myth-shattering book, based on thousands of newly discovered documents, hours of newly available footage from her final film, and over 300 revealing new interviews, is a detailed and astonishing account of what really happened during the last fourteen weeks in the life of Hollywood's legendary sex goddess. Recreating the drama of a bygone era of glamour and intrigue, it presents compelling evidence that Marilyn Monroe was the victim of two conspiracies that, together, brought about her professional and personal downfall: an elaborate scheme on the part of a once-mighty film studio teetering on the brink of bankruptcy; and an even more sinister plot masterminded by America's First Family. Among the shattering, totally authenticated revelations: the searing details of Marilyn's affairs with John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, including her famous birthday song to JFK and her final series of rendezvous with RFK; how Marilyn was sabotaged by executives of 20th Century-Fox and psychologically shredded on the set by a predatory pack led by vengeful director George Cukor; how the cruel competition between Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor sealed Marilyn's fate with the studio bosses; the role the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service played in blanketing the scene of her death and in the disposal of her private papers and personal effects; and why the accidental overdose theory cannot stand.

A painter, writer, and friend of Blake, Byron, and Keats, Wainewright was almost certainly a murderer.

The Allies have punished Germany for its war crimes by forcing it to revert to a preindustrial age: power stations, railways, factories, and all the machinery of technology have been destroyed or abandoned and left to decay. Moor is a small quarry town (Mauthausen in the all-too-recent past of real history). The occupying American army has installed a camp survivor, Ambras, to govern the local population. Brave, lonely, hated and feared by his former persecutors, Ambras has returned to Moor only because his Jewish wife died there. Setting up house in a derelict villa surrounded by wild hounds that earn him the nickname the Dog King, he chooses another loner, the village boy Bering, as his bodyguard. Moving away from his family and into the compound, the boy enters a new universe of power, of half-glimpsed ideas, of contact with the forbidden world outside. And he meets the only other person Ambras welcomes, a strange and beautiful orphan girl named Lily who lives and hunts in the hills, who knows where the weapons are hidden and forages in the free\u00a0\u00a0world for the goods the villagers crave.

In Altered Egos, Dr. Todd Feinberg presents a new theory of the self, based on his first-hand experience as both a psychiatrist and neurologist. Feinberg first introduces the reader to dozens of intriguing cases of patients whose disorders have resulted in what he calls altered egos: a change in the brain that transforms the boundaries of the self. He describes patients who suffer from alien hand syndrome where one hand might attack the patient's own throat, patients with frontal lobe damage who invent fantastic stories about their lives, paralyzed patients who reject and disown one of their limbs. Feinberg argues that the brain damage suffered by these people has done more than simply impair certain functions--it has fragmented their sense of self. After illustrating how these patients provide a window into the self and the mind, the author presents a new model of the self that links the workings of the brain with unique and personal features of the mind, such as meaning, purpose, and being. Drawing on his own and other evidence, Feinberg explains how the unified self, while not located in one or another brain region, arises out of the staggering complexity and number of the brain's component parts.  Lucid, insightful, filled with fascinating case studies and provocative new ideas, Altered Egos promises to change the way we think about human consciousness and the creation and maintenance of human identity.", "genre": ["Psychology", "Neuroscience", "Science", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Todd E.

Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, The Golden Compass, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal d\u00e6mon, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied:  As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had d\u00e6mons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them.  Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war. But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her d\u00e6mon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey d\u00e6mon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from gyptians to witches to an armor-clad polar bear.  In The Golden Compass, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, The Subtle Knife, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. --Alix Wilber\n...more", "genre": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Childrens", "Adventure", "Childrens", "Middle Grade", "Science Fiction", "Classics", "Science Fiction Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Steampunk"], "author": "Philip Pullman", "rating": "4.01", "pages": "432"}, {"id": 608586, "title": "The Rules II: More Rules to Live and Love By", "blurb": "Picking up where The Rules left off, this book addresses such topics as: how to deal with long distance relationships; how to win back an ex-boyfriend; and--most importantly--how to make sure the engagement leads to marriage.

Beginning in St. Louis, they navigated up the Missouri River and through the prairies, enduring a winter with the Mandan Indians in North Dakota, reaching the summit of the Rocky Mountains and then following the Columbia River to their final destination, the Pacific Ocean. Trained in natural history and in the methods of collecting plant and animal samples, Lewis and Clark carefully and meticulously recorded the conditions of the rivers, prairies, forests, mountains, and wildlife of pre-industrial America. Now, in this new edition of Our Natural History, Daniel B. Botkin, a distinguished botanist and naturalist, re-creates the grand journey--taking us on an exciting ecological adventure back to the landscape of the great American West. In retracing their steps, Botkin reveals what this western landscape actually looked like and how much it's been changed by modern civilization and technology. With fresh insight, Botkin shows us that from the explorers' observations, we can learn much about the environment of our past, our environment today, and what our environment might be in the future. Now with a new Afterword marking the 200th anniversary of the expedition, this timely and thought-provoking book captures our imagination and stimulates our sentiment with lessons about our environment and our place within it.

I had a cousin, Randall, killed on Iwo Jima. Have I told you?So begins Kate Walbert's beautiful and heart-breaking novel about a young woman, Ellen, coming of age in the long shadow of World War II. Forty years later she relates the events of this period, beginning with the death of her favorite cousin, Randall, with whom she had shared Easter Sundays, secrets, and, perhaps, love. In an isolated, aging Maryland farmhouse that once was a stop on the Underground Railroad, Randall had grown up among ghosts: his father, Sterling, present only in body; his mother, dead at a young age; and the apparitions of a slave family. When Ellen receives a package after Randall's death, containing his diary and a book called The Gardens of Kyoto, her bond to him is cemented, and the mysteries of his short life start to unravel.The narrative moves back and forth between Randall's death in 1945 and the autumn six years later, when Ellen meets Lieutenant Henry Rock at a college football game on the eve of his departure for Korea. But it soon becomes apparent that Ellen's memory may be distorting reality, altered as it is by a mix of imagination and disappointment, and that the truth about Randall and Henry -- and others -- may be hidden. With lyrical, seductive prose, Walbert spins several parallel stories of the emotional damage done by war. Like the mysterious arrangements of the intricate sand, rock, and gravel gardens of Kyoto, they gracefully assemble into a single, rich mosaic.Based on a Pushcart and O. Henry Prize-winning story, this masterful first novel establishes Walbert as a writer of astonishing elegance and power.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Cultural", "Japan", "Historical", "War", "World War II", "Cultural", "Asia", "Novels", "War", "Contemporary", "Adult Fiction"], "author": "Kate Walbert", "rating": "3.43", "pages": "288"}, {"id": 608864, "title": "Tone Deaf and All Thumbs?: An Invitation to Music-Making", "blurb": "This blend of anecdote and scientific analysis is an absorbing study of our innate musical abilities, for both the adult beginner and the serious listener.

Maoist China provides an example of extreme human interference in the natural world in an era in which human relationships were also unusually distorted. Under Mao, the traditional Chinese ideal of harmony between heaven and humans was abrogated in favor of Mao's insistence that Man Must Conquer Nature. Mao and the Chinese Communist Party's war to bend the physical world to human will often had disastrous consequences both for human beings and the natural environment. Mao's War Against Nature argues that the abuse of people and the abuse of nature are often linked. Shapiro's account, told in part through the voices of average Chinese citizens and officials who lived through and participated in some of the destructive campaigns, is both eye-opening and heartbreaking. Judith Shapiro teaches environmental politics at American University in Washington, DC. She is co-author, with Liang Heng, of several well known books on China, including Son of the Revolution (Random House, 1984) and After the Nightmare (Knopf, 1986).

The fourth, a five-year-old boy, lies comatose in the hospital and might not survive. Who would do such a thing? The answer comes in the form of a gunman crashing through the door of the hotel room where Jill Clark is staying. With a rifle barrel pointed at her temple, the young attorney suddenly finds herself the hostage of a desperate man whose actions hardly fit his claim that he's innocent of the bombing. Only later, when the suspect is behind bars, does Jill wonder whether he's as guilty as he appears. Prompted by a terrifying attempt on her life, Jill and old flame Dan Nichols dig deeper into the case. But standing in their way lies an obstacle Jill hasn't counted on: the power of a covenant. It could change her life. Or, with the clock ticking, it could seal her death. Word of Honor is book three in the Newpointe 911 series by award-winning novelist Terri Blackstock.

This was due not only to its sophisticated use of historical, literary, and philosophical disciplines but also to the sensitive way in which they were combined and to the novel insights that resulted when this combination was focused on individual parables.The present book continues most directly and explicitly the study initiated by In Parables and may be regarded as bringing that earlier volume up to date on three major issues.Conceptually, the emphasis on metaphor from In Parables has led to the discussion of polyvalence, or semantic pluralism, in Jesus's parables. Pluralistic meaning is an intensely paradoxical concept and it raises issues that touch the very roots of our consciousness and our reality. Metaphor is now no longer a clearing within the forest of language but is rather the very ground of that language itself. Any given metaphor illumines and reveals the radical metaphoricity of all reality.Philosophically, the question is raised whether the polyvalence inherent in metaphor, along with the critically iterated claims for its untranslatability, may be better explained as a surplus of meaning, or as an absence of the meaning, a refusal of canonical meaning, which is then the necessary but negative basis for the plurality of meanings and the abiding fecundity of interpretations.Exegetically, as specific example and deliberate narratival metaphor of the entire book, Jesus's serenely pastoral parable of the Sower, with its specified triad of gains, itsplurality or polyvalence both of failure and success, is centrally discussed as textual focus for the volume.About the Author:John Dominic Crossan is Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies at DePaul University, Chicago\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Theology"], "author": "John Dominic Crossan", "rating": "3.50", "pages": "120"}, {"id": 611337, "title": "Buddhist Scriptures", "blurb": "Striving to understand the truth of the human condition and determining the path to spiritual enlightenment is the fundamental nature of Buddhism.

The civilizations of Mesopotamia, India, Egypt, China, and West Africa, as well as Europe, leave their mark on American literature, which looks dramatically different when it is removed from a strictly national or English-language context.

Emerson emerges as a translator of Islamic culture; Henry James's novels become long-distance kin to Gilgamesh; and Black English loses its ungrammaticalness when reclassified as a creole tongue, meshing the input from Africa, Europe, and the Americas.Throughout, Dimock contends that American literature is answerable not to the nation-state, but to the human species as a whole, and that it looks dramatically different when removed from a strictly national or English-language context.", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Literary Criticism", "Theory"], "author": "Wai Chee Dimock", "rating": "3.76", "pages": "264"}, {"id": 611571, "title": "Street Talk-1: How to Speak and Understand American Slang", "blurb": "1998 OPTIMA BOOKS SOFTCOVER", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Language"], "author": "David Burke", "rating": "4.10", "pages": "270"}, {"id": 611586, "title": "Storia vera", "blurb": "La Storia vera, capolavoro di Luciano, viene considerata la prima narrazione fantascientifica, l'antesignana e il paradigma della funzione scientifica che supera gli spazi e i tempi logici delle conoscenze umane.

Born into a slave-holding family, Rose moved to Washington, D.C., as a young woman and soon established herself as one of the capital\u2019s most charming and influential socialites, an intimate of John C. Calhoun, James Buchanan, and Dolley Madison. She married well, bore eight children and buried five, and, at the height of the Gold Rush, accompanied her husband Robert Greenhow to San Francisco.

Overnight, Rose Greenhow, fashionable hostess, become Rose Greenhow, intrepid spy. As Blackman reveals, deadly accurate intelligence that Rose supplied to General Pierre G. T. Beauregard written in a fascinating code (the code duplicated in the background on the jacket of this book). Her message to Beauregard turned the tide in the first Battle of Bull Run, and was a brilliant piece of spycraft that eventually led to her arrest by Allan Pinkerton and imprisonment with her young daughter. Indomitable, Rose regained her freedom and, as the war reached a crisis, journeyed to Europe to plead the Confederate cause at the royal courts of England and France. Drawing on newly discovered diaries and a rich trove of contemporary accounts, Blackman has fashioned a thrilling, intimate narrative that reads like a novel.

When the Second World War brought economic recovery, politicians and planners of the 1940s confidently anticipated a new golden age for big cities. But the postwar boom never came, and urban America has been waiting for the renaissance ever since. InThe Rough Road to Renaissance, Jon C. Teaford describes efforts in twelve older central cities in the Northeast and Midwest to achieve revitalization during the period from 1940 to 1985. Focusing on the view from City Hall rather than on state or federal perspectives, Teaford explores the changing trends in city politics and municipal finance as well as the policies that pursued the elusive goal of urban renaissance. He also considers the environmental, transportation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction programs undertaken to create better cities and to close the widening competitive gap with suburbia. In the early fifties, Teaford explains, big cities were planning for a bright future. Crosstown highways, low-income highrises, and vigorous demolition drastically altered the urban landscape and confidently anticipated new development. But the automobile culture was already derailing urban renewal as city dwellers sought the good life in the suburbs. By the late sixties, rising crime, racial tension, labor militancy, and a wave of abandonment seemed to offer further evidence of impending urban demise. Yet in the 1980s, messiah mayors and visionary planners boosted the hopes and morale of urban residents. Once again there was talk of renaissance, but beneath the facade of revival serious problems persisted. In The Rough Road to Renaissance, Jon Teaford tells a story that residents of Boston, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, St. Louis, and other famous urban centers will recognize-- a story that is still being written\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Jon C.

It draws on things both old and new: on the wisdom of the Bible, enshrined in Benedictine liturgy, on the experience of modern monks, and on the wisdom of the Christian Church throughout her long and varied history. Coming as it does from an Irish monastery, it reflects in a special way the Celtic tradition with its earthy, popular and devotional prayers. Beautifully bound and designed, it is both prayer and inspiration.The first section is a simplified Liturgy of the Hours to dedicate and bless those two great moments of the day that bear witness to Christ: morning, when we celebrate his rising as the light of the world, and evening, when we acclaim him as the unquenchable light that never sets. Through psalms, canticles, and other words of scripture, through invocations and concluding prayers, the day is hallowed and the presence of the risen Christ is gratefully remembered.In addition, elements have been included stemming from the ancient custom of consecrating special moments to the Lord in the bustle of the daily round. These prayer-stops are the modern equivalent to monastic \u201cLittle Hours,\u201d recalling as they do the coming of the Holy Spirit and the dramatic events of Christ's passion. They are an invitation and an opportunity to pause in the midst of work and turn our hearts to God.Night prayer (Compline), the last monastic office of the day, is included as the prayer before sleep. Its haunting psalms and canticles, its prayers for protection, its calling upon Mary are some of the most beautiful treasures from the storehouse of monastic prayer. They lead us gently across the bridge of sleep, from the glaring light of day to the dark cradle of the night and the world of dreams.This liturgical section includes a seasonal element so that the great festivals of the Christian year may be incorporated in our prayer, and a calendar of saints\u2019 days so that they can be commemorated. A selection of prayers for that purpose is also provided. These can be used in place of the prayer at the end of morning and evening prayer.The second section consists of familiar prayers, those tried and tested prayer texts stretching back through the centuries: the Lord\u2019s Prayer, the Apostles\u2019 Creed, the Stations of the Cross, the Rosary, and many others.The third section, ritual prayers, provides prayer forms for various needs and occasions as they arise in every life, and a series of blessings. It will be a valuable and useful resource for the many times when spoken or formal prayers are looked for in situations of necessity, sorrow, joy, or grief. The Celtic element is particularly marked in this part of the book. There is also a special prayer for Benedictine Oblates.The fourth and final part includes psalms (to supplement the liturgical section or for meditation) and a series of quotations from the Rule of Saint Benedict. The latter, encapsulating the wisdom of this great foundational text of Christian civilization, can be read as part of night prayer (Compline) or simply meditated or ruminated upon as a source of inspiration in one\u2019s spiritual life.Thus, The Glenstal Book of Prayer provides for the whole sweep of prayer. It captures that movement of the Holy Spirit in the human heart that is prayer and through which God reaches out and embraces us.Includes two-color printing throughout and a ribbon marker.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion"], "author": "Monks of Glenstal Abbey", "rating": "4.11", "pages": "160"}, {"id": 612828, "title": "Prospero and Caliban: The Psychology of Colonization", "blurb": "In his now classic volume Prospero and Caliban, Octave Mannoni gives his firsthand account of a 1948 revolt in Madagascar that led to one of the bloodiest episodes of colonial repression on the African continent.

Now, in It's Not About the Bra, Chastain steps out from behind her iconic image to deliver an important wake-up call to competitive youth sports, which has gone increasingly out of control.Drawing on anecdotes from her own storied career as well as those of her coaches and celebrated teammates (Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and others), Chastain tackles the thorny issues of sportsmanship, gamesmanship, and parental involvement gone too far. She teaches young athletes how to develop leadership skills, find (and become) role models, and give something back to their team and community. Her timely message is about rediscovering our respect for the game, for teammates and adversaries, for coaches and refs, and, especially, for the players themselves, because without these values the game breaks down and the joys of competition are lost.From her struggle to rebound from consecutive knee surgeries to excruciating losses in NCAA, World Cup, and Olympic competition to her recent battle to make the team she loves, Chastain discloses both the good and bad ways she's personally dealt with adversity and reminds us what it truly means to be a class act on and off the field.Whether it's Little League baseball, Pop Warner football, or, especially, top-flight youth soccer, Chastain offers a blueprint for kids and parents alike on how to play fair, win (and lose) with grace, and, above all, how to have a good time doing it.
