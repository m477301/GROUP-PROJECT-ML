What is commonly viewed as a discrete military conflict between an aggressive Japan with imperial ambitions and a reluctant, passive America now becomes the stuff of Greek tragedy. The overreaching British Empire is waning, yet is unwilling to relinquish its foothold in China, while an increasingly ambitious Japan is determined to dominate the region and conquer China as part of that plan. Enter the young upstart, America, with imperial ambitions of its own in Asia. The United States meant to replace Britain as the dominant power in Asia and saw Japan as a direct threat to that dominance. For Franklin Delano Roosevelt and for the United States, the war with Japan had little to do with revenge for Pearl Harbor. Japan would have to be vanquished so that it would never again be an imperial rival. This recasting of the Asian conflict profoundly alters our understanding not just of World War II in the Pacific but also of what followed in the Korean War and the war in Vietnam. Revisionist history at its best, Empires on the Pacific will provoke discussion and debate and it will alter our view of what many still consider the last good war. Interest in WWII has never been higher: The summertime release of Touchstone Pictures' blockbuster Pearl Harbor-accompanied by Basic Books' own Pearl Harbor (April 19 release)-will create tremendous interest in the Pacific theater of WWII. Timely publication: The book anticipates the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 2001. Striking, revisionist, controversial: America's wartime actions in the Pacific were not revenge for Pearl Harbor but were part of America's larger imperial ambitions to replace the British Empire as the dominant force in Asia, and, especially, in China. America won the war with Japan but lost the peace, which led, inevitably, to the Korean War and to the war in Vietnam.

In Asian Flavors of Jean-Georges, he presents dozens of recipes for reproducing the dishes that have made his restaurants--Vong, Spice Market, and 66--the hottest dining destinations in New York City.Jean-Georges began his love affair with Asian food when he became the chef de cuisine at the renowned Oriental Hotel in Bangkok at the age of twenty-three. His trips to the markets of Bangkok sparked a lifelong obsession with ingredients like ginger, lemongrass, curry pastes and powders, and all kinds of exotic fruits and vegetables. In 1992, when he came to New York to cook at Lafayette in the Drake Hotel, he was the first to combine the flavors of Thailand with French technique. The restaurant was a sensation, immediately earning four stars from the New York Times, and launching his dazzling career in the United States.In 1997, he opened an outpost of Vong in Hong Kong and discovered the world of authentic and refined Chinese cooking and ingredients. As he says, \u201cEvery meal in Hong Kong contain[s] a thousand flavors.\u201d He opened 66 in New York to showcase his newfound passion for the Chinese kitchen.And then in 2003 he opened Spice Market, his homage to Asian street food, after five years of research and extensive travels through Southeast Asia (documented in the photos in this book). Once again, he translated Asian cuisine through a French sensibility for American diners. Spice Market instantly became his most popular restaurant and remains one of New York\u2019s most sought-after reservations.Now Jean-Georges has brought together the best of his pan-Asian recipes in one exciting cookbook. The recipes reflect Jean-Georges\u2019s extraordinary talent for creating intensely flavorful dishes inspired by simple home cooking and street food. The secret is his subtle and surprising combinations, which, as in his restaurants, introduce Asian flavors to traditional Western-style dishes and cooking techniques. His special approach comes deliciously to life in such main courses as Grilled Chicken with Kumquat Lemongrass Dressing, Black Pepper Shrimp with \u201cSun-Dried\u201d Pineapple, Cod with Malaysian Chili Sauce, and Lamb Shank Braised with Green Curry and Vegetables. Unusual side dishes include Steamed Spicy Eggplant and Coconut Sticky Rice. For dessert, there are treats like Chocolate and Vietnamese Coffee Tart or a Seasonal Fruit Plate with Lime-Spiced Salt. Each recipe is laid out in a clear, easy-to-follow style, and throughout the book invaluable tips are offered for streamlining preparation and cooking. From taste-tempting appetizers, soups, and salads, to irresistible fish, meat, poultry, and vegetable dishes, to special sauces and one-of-a-kind sweets, the recipes in Asian Flavors of Jean-Georges promise to make dining at home as exciting as an evening out at one of Jean-Georges's fabulous restaurants.\n...more", "genre": ["Food and Drink", "Cookbooks", "Food and Drink", "Cooking"], "author": "Jean-Georges Vongerichten", "rating": "4.10", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 400051, "title": "Snowboard Twist", "blurb": "It's snowboarding season in the Teton Mountains, and the snow at Glory Bowl is fresh.

Originally published in 1970, Consuming Passions now features a new afterword by acclaimed food writer Paul Levy, bringing the story right up the 21st century.\n...more", "genre": ["Food and Drink", "Food", "Nonfiction", "History", "Food and Drink"], "author": "Philippa Pullar", "rating": "3.52", "pages": "296"}, {"id": 400155, "title": "Distant Rain: A Conversation Between Jakucho Setouchi and Tess Gallagher", "blurb": "Distant Rain records a conversation between the eloquent American poet Tess Gallagher and the renowned Japanese novelist and Buddhist nun Jakucho Setouchi that took place in 1990 at Jakuan, Setouchi's home temple, in Sagano, Japan.Gallagher had recently experienced the death of her husband, Raymond Carver, an internationally renowned short story writer.

Compelling evidence, assembled here for the first time, strongly suggests that the sub, K-129, sank while attempting to fire a nuclear missile, most likely at the naval base at Pearl Harbor.We now know that the Soviets had lost track of the sub; it had become a rogue. While the Soviets searched in vain for the boat, U.S. intelligence was able to pinpoint the site of the disaster. The new Nixon administration launched a clandestine, half-billion-dollar project to recover the sunken K-129. Contrary to years of deliberately misleading reports, the recovery operation was a great success. With the recovery of the sub, it became clear that the rogue was attempting to mimic a Chinese submarine, almost certainly with the intention of provoking a war between the U.S. and China. This was a carefully planned operation that, had it succeeded, would have had devastating consequences. During the successful recovery effort, the U.S. forged new relationships with the USSR and China. Could the information gleaned from the sunken sub have been a decisive factor shaping the new policies of detente between the Americans and the Soviets, and opening China to the West? And who in the USSR could have planned such a bold and potentially catastrophic operation?Red Star Rogue reads like something straight out of a Tom Clancy novel, but it is all true.

Eventually, though, the word came to be most closely identified with those southerners who were staunch and unyielding advocates of secession. In this broadly researched and illuminating study, Eric H. Walther examines the lives of nine of the most prominent fire-eaters: Nathaniel Beverly Tucker, William Lowndes Yancey, John Anthony Quitman, Robert Barnwell Rhett, Laurence M. Keitt, Louis T. Wigfall, James D.B. De Bow, Edmund Ruffin, and William Porcher Miles.Walther paints skillful portraits of his subjects, analyzing their backgrounds, personalities, and contributions to the movement for disunion. Although they shared the common goal of southern independence, Walther shows that in many respects the fire-eaters differed markedly from one another. It was their very diversity, he maintains, that enabled them to appeal to such a wide spectrum of southern opinion and thereby rally support for secession.In his exploration of the role of the fire-eaters in the secession movement, Walther touches upon a number of perennial themes in southern history, including the appeal of proslavery thought and southern expansionism, the place of education and industrialization in antebellum southern society, the significance of oratory in southern culture, and the nature of southern nationalism. He also describes the fire-eaters' activities on behalf of the Confederacy and traces the course of their lives after the war.The Fire-Eaters makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the secession movement and the context in which it developed. There is no other study available that treats these men as a group and that delineates their manifold differences as well as their similarities. Walther shows that secessionism was not a monolithic ideology but rather a movement that emerged from many sources, spoke in many voices, and responded to a number of regional problems, needs, and aspirations.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Military History", "Civil War"], "author": "Eric H.

Betsy Hearne brings a storyteller's verve and insight to an examination of one of western culture's most powerful and persistent myths. She explores the story's folkloristic background and then traces the modern tale from its literary shaping in the mid-1700s through its re-creations in the form of chapbook, drama, poetry, novel, picturebook, and film. Hearne contrasts Apuleius' second-century Cupid and Psyche, a closely related tale, with Madame de Beaumont's eighteenth-century Beauty and the Beast, published at a time when oral and literary traditions were merging. Nineteeth-century versions, affected by innovations in book production and printing, combined lavish illustrations with moral instruction, a greater divergence in narrative voice, and a heightened intention to entertain. In the twentieth century the emphasis on narrative has given way to themes of psychological complexity, a shift complemented by new media techniques, mass market distribution, and a renaissance in children's literature.Despite the myriad variations of detail exhibited over three centuries, Hearne discovers certain underlying motifs crucial to the tale's survival in literature as well as in folklore. By tracing such structural elements as character, narrative voice, image, object, and symbol through many versions, she identifies the patterns that have sustained the story's fundamental and irrepressible appeal. This focus on the art and artifice of the tale shows that its resilience lies in a metaphorical strength more flexible than most interpretations suggest.Generously illustrated with images from some of the many editions of Beauty and the Beast, Hearne's book also contains an essay by Larry DeVries with a structural analysis of the folk narrative, reproductions of versions from the the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, a list of nineteenth-century printed editions of the tale, and an extensive bibliography of other versions. This lively study will appeal to a broad audience of folklorists, literary critics, children's book specialists, historians, psychologists, bibliophiles, and all who have been transformed by the reading and telling of tales.\n...more", "genre": ["Fantasy", "Fairy Tales", "Nonfiction", "Fairy Tales", "Beauty and The Beast", "Reference", "Fantasy", "Mythology", "Folklore", "Retellings", "Criticism", "Literary Criticism", "Criticism"], "author": "Betsy Hearne", "rating": "3.93", "pages": "247"}, {"id": 402056, "title": "Belle and the Beau", "blurb": "BelleAfter a grueling escape north, Belle Palmer is free, yet lost and alone.

Specifically, this book considers the coordinating role of three major nonprice institutions--ethnic trading networks, contract law, and gift-exchange--in economizing on transaction costs and thus facilitating the process of exchange in decentralized economies in different historical contexts.The major unifying theme of the book is this: identity matters when traders operate in an environment characterized by contract uncertainty, where the legal framework for the enforcement of contracts is not well developed. This in turn points out the importance of trust embedded in particularistic exchange relations such as kinship or ethnicity.One unique facet of this book is that the author uses a property rights--public choice approach--part of the New Institutional Economics--to provide a unifying theoretical framework to explain such diverse exchange institutions as contract law, ethnic trading networks, and gift-exchange, In addition, it goes beyond the New Institutional Economics paradigm by incorporating some crucial concepts from sociology, anthropology, and bioeconomics, such as social structure, social norms, culture, reciprocity, and kin-related altruism.

The goal of Yukihiro Matsumoto, creator of Ruby and author of this book, is to incorporate the strengths of languages like Perl, Python, Lisp and Smalltalk. Ruby is a genuine attempt to combine the best of everything in the scripting world. Since 1993, Ruby mailing lists have been established, Web pages have formed, and a community has grown around it. The language itself is very good at text processing and is notable for its broad object orientation. Ruby is portable and runs under GNU/Linux (and other Unices) as well as DOS, MS Windows and Mac.With Ruby in a Nutshell, Matsumoto offers a practical reference to the features of this new language including the command-line options, syntax, built-in variables, functions, and many commonly used classes and modules. This guide covers the current stable version of Ruby (1.6), yet is applicable to the development version 1.7 and the next planned stable version 1.8. You will find a thorough description of Ruby's language syntax, and a description of the core functionality built into the standard Ruby interpreter, which has more than 800 built-in methods in 42 classes and modules.Ruby finds its power through its built-in libraries, and this handy volume take you through the many useful libraries that come with the standard Ruby distribution--from network access via HTTP and CGI programming, to data persistence using the DBM library.

Taken together, the chapters offer to the student and the general reader a complete semiotics of clothing in a form that is highly readable, very entertaining, and thoroughly informative. The illustrations provide fascinating glimpses into the history of American fashion and clothing-along with their antecedents in Europe-as well as a fine collection of images from the more familiar world of contemporary America.Rubinstein has identified six distinct categories of dress in American society, upon which Dress Codes is based. Clothing signs were instituted by those in authority, have one meaning, indicate behavior, and are required attire (police uniforms, or the clothing of ministers and priests); \u201cclothing symbols, on the other hand, reflect the achievement of cultural values\u2014wealth, beauty, you and health. The wearing of clothing symbols\u2014designer clothing or jewelry\u2014may have several meanings; \u2018clothing tie-signs,\u201d which are specific types of clothing that indicate membership in a community outside mainstream culture (Hasidic, Amish, or Hare Krishna attire). They were instituted by those in authority, have one meaning, they indicate expected behavior, and are required attire; \u201cclothing tie symbols\u201d emanate from hopes, fears, and dreams of particular groups. They include trendy styles such as hip-hop, hippie, and gothic. Another category, \u201ccontemporary fashion,\u201d reflects consumer sentiments and the political and economic forces of the period. \u201cPersonal dress,\u201d refers to the I component we bring in when dressing the public self (bowtie, dramatic, or artistic attire). Many of these images have their roots in the \u201ccollective memory\u201d of western society.

Originally a trilogy, this is now a four-part series.  \u201cBoudica\u201d means \u201cBringer of Victory\u201d (from the early Celtic word \u201cboudeg\u201d). She was the last defender of the Celtic culture; the only woman openly to lead her warriors into battle and to stand successfully against the might of Imperial Rome -- and triumph.  Book one, Dreaming the Eagle, took readers from Boudica\u2019s girlhood with the Eceni tribe to the climax of the two-day battle when she and her lover, Caradoc, faced the invading Romans. Believing her dead, Breaca\u2019s beloved brother, B\u00e1n, joined the Roman cause.  Dreaming the Bull, the second book in this compelling series, continues the intertwined stories of Boudica, and B\u00e1n, now an officer in the Roman cavalry. They stand on opposite sides in a brutal war of attrition between the occupying army and the defeated tribes, each determined to see the other dead. In a country under occupation, Caradoc, lover to Breaca, is caught and faces the ultimate penalty. Only B\u00e1n has the power to save him, and B\u00e1n has spent the past ten years denying his past. Treachery divides these two; heroism brings them together again, changed out of all recognition -- but it may not be enough to heal the wounds.  Dreaming the Bull is a heart-stopping story of war and of peace; of love, passion and betrayal; of druids and warring gods, where each life is sacred and each death even more so; and where Breaca and B\u00e1n learn the terrible distances they must travel to fulfill their own destinies.   Through the summer, Cunomar came to recognize two different kinds of warriors. The smaller group consisted of those few men and women still alive who had known his mother before the two-day battle against the invading legions. These were her friends and they called her Breaca in the way Cunomar\u2019s father and the innermost circle of the honour guard still did. The rest, who had met her only in battle or, worse, knew her only by reputation, gave the warrior\u2019s salute in a way that was subtly different and hailed her as the Boudica, bringer of victory. She didn\u2019t enjoy that, but in the short span of his life, Cunomar had watched his mother become more comfortable with name, so that it settled on her like a worn cloak and she did not stiffen at the sound of it.   He had heard her use the word herself for the first time that morning as a cold dawn sharpened the air and Nemain, the moon, lowered into her bed in the mountains. Breaca had stood on the back of her mare and addressed the massed ranks of warriors and dreamers, naming them all Boudegae, bringers of victory, and swearing before them that she would fight for as long as it took to rid the land of the invader. -- from Dreaming the Bull", "genre": ["Historical Fiction", "Historical", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Ancient History", "British Literature", "Historical Fantasy"], "author": "Manda Scott", "rating": "4.27", "pages": "384"}, {"id": 404840, "title": "Stronger Than Death", "blurb": "Sometimes tragedies come in waves.

Although they are seemingly disparate, these writers are united by their experimentation with style and form. Mackey, an important contemporary poet and critic, focuses on the experimental aspects of their work rather than on its subject matter or authorship to show that they all share an implied critique of conventional poetic practices.Mackey analyzes the work of Black Mountain poets Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and Charles Olson, African American poets Amiri Baraka and Clarence Major, and Caribbean writers Edward Kamau Brathwaite and Wilson Harris. He frequently brings the work of these authors into dialogue and juxtaposition, noting the parallels and counterpoint that exist among writers normally separated by ethnic, temporal, or regional boundaries. By insisting that their experimentation unites these writers rather than marginalizes them, Mackey questions traditional notions that underlie conventional perceptions and practice.In his epilogue and bibliographic essay, volume editor Michael Conniff suggests new directions for further research and offers a comprehensive survey of the evolution of major writings, theories, and methodologies in the field.\n...more", "genre": ["Poetry", "Philosophy", "Theory", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Essays"], "author": "Nathaniel Mackey", "rating": "4.70", "pages": "214"}, {"id": 405279, "title": "The Stars Above Vera Cruz", "blurb": "A high-wire artist named Ropedancer is our guide to Gifford's world in The Stars Above Veracruz.

Students of his work have often dismissed this comment as simply a metaphor for the transformative power of using found images in a new context. Taking a wholly different perspective on Ernst and alchemy, however, M. E. Warlick persuasively demonstrates that the artist had a profound and abiding interest in alchemical philosophy and often used alchemical symbolism in works created throughout his career.A revival of interest in alchemy swept the artistic, psychoanalytic, historical, and scientific circles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Warlick sets Ernst's work squarely within this movement. Looking at both his art (many of the works she discusses are reproduced in the book) and his writings, she reveals how thoroughly alchemical philosophy and symbolism pervade his early Dadaist experiments, his foundational work in surrealism, and his many collages and paintings of women and landscapes, whose images exemplify the alchemical fusing of opposites.

When a young man named Rej discovers the body of a murdered Abover in the combes, their worlds begin to draw closer. He swears vengeance for the murdered man and takes a great risk in going above. There he is placed in the care of Donna, a beautiful young woman trapped in her life as a worker. Food and clothing are rationed, while slaves and workers are forced to live in meager barracks. But Rej and Donna have more in common than a miserable existence; they have weirdly identical dreams of dragons flying in a clear blue sky. They are even more surprised to learn that the city's cruel leader, the Arkel, is determined to find a way to bring just such dreams to life in order to literally scare the population to death. The connection Rej and Donna make leads them on a dramatic adventure to save their loved ones from the Arkel's terrifying plans. N. M.

Recent research reporting that a one degree Celsius rise in temperature can reduce grain yields by 10 per cent means that energy policy is now directly affecting crop production. Agriculture is a water-intensive activity and, while public attention has focused on oil depletion, it is aquifer depletion that poses the more serious threat. There are substitutes for oil, but none for water and the link between our fossil fuel addiction, climate change and food security is now clear. While population growth has slowed over the past three decades, we are still adding 76 million people per year. In a world where the historical rise in land productivity has slowed by half since 1990, eradicating hunger may depend as much on family planners as on farmers. The bottom line is that future food security depends not only on efforts within agriculture but also on energy policies that stabilize climate, a worldwide effort to raise water productivity, the evolution of land-efficient transport systems, and population policies that seek a humane balance between population and food.

This collection of more than twenty true stories from a ranch of rescued dreams unveils the heart of true strength and the character of genuine courage. Experience for yourself the kind of love and hope that change a person from the inside out. Because sometimes, just believing in someone is enough for them to start believing in themselves.

Coming from a family whose loyalty to Southern nationhood transcended its disdain for slavery and the rationales for the war itself, Fletcher joined the famed Texas Brigade under General Stonewall Jackson. He was wounded several times and escaped from a moving Union Army prison train before he, and his compatriots in gray, surrendered to the victorious forces of the North. After retiring from the lumber business in East Texas in 1902, William A. Fletcher decided to record his remembrances as a veteran of the War of Secession, and soon after he privately published this fascinating account of his exploits. But a fire destroyed all but a few copies before they could be distributed.

Women\u2019s Barracks was banned for obscenity in several states.

With wit and irony, Khyentse urges readers to move beyond the superficial trappings of Buddhism beyond a romance with beads, incense, and exotic people in robes straight to the heart of what the Buddha taught.In essence, this book explains what a Buddhist really is, namely, someone who deeply understands the truth of impermanence and how our emotions can trap us in cycles of suffering.

Undaunted, however, Temple is back, with 140 pages of new scientific evidence that makes his hypothesis more compelling than ever. Many authors have speculated on the subject of extraterrestrial contact, but never before has such detailed evidence been presented. Temple applies his in-depth knowledge of ancient history, mythology, Pythagorean physics, chaos theory, and Greek, to a close examination of the measurements of the Great Pyramid of Giza, which was built to align directly with the star Sirius. He concludes that the alien civilization of Sirius and our own civilization are part of the same harmonic system, and are destined to function and resonate together.

While the Egyptians and Babylonians had accomplished much of astronomical worth, it remained for the unrivalled speculative genius of the Greeks, in particular, their mathematical genius, to lay the foundations of the true science of astronomy. In this classic study, a noted scholar discusses in lucid detail the specific advances made by the Greeks, many of whose ideas anticipated the discoveries of modern astronomy.Pythagoras, born at Samos about 572 B.C., was probably the first to hold that the earth is spherical in shape, while his later followers anticipated Copernicus with the then-startling hypothesis that the earth was not the center of the universe but a planet like the others. Heraclides of Pontus (c. 388\u2013315 B.C.), a pupil of Plato, declared that the apparent daily rotation of the heavenly bodies is due, not to a rotation of the heavenly sphere about an axis through the center of the earth, but to the rotation of the earth itself around its own axis. Secondly, Heraclides discovered that Venus and Mercury revolve around the sun like satellites. Perhaps the greatest astronomer of antiquity was Hipparchus, who flourished between 161 and 126 B.C. He compiled a catalog of fixed stars to the number 850 or more, made great improvements in the instruments used for astronomical observations, and discovered the precession of the equinoxes, among other accomplishments. The astronomy of Hipparchus takes its definitive form in the Syntaxis (commonly called the Almagest) of Ptolemy, written about A.D. 150, which held the field until the time of Copernicus.The extraordinary achievements of these and many more Greek theorists are given full coverage in this erudite account, which blends exceptional clarity with a readable style to produce a work that is not only indispensable for astronomers and historians of science but easily accessible to science-minded lay readers.", "genre": ["Astronomy", "Science", "Mathematics", "Nonfiction", "History"], "author": "Thomas Little Heath", "rating": "3.81", "pages": "256"}, {"id": 410112, "title": "The Year's Best Science Fiction: Twenty-Fourth Annual Collection", "blurb": "The twenty-eight stories in this collection imaginatively take us far across the universe, into the very core of our beings, to the realm of the gods, and the moment just after now.

In traveling the circuit of the eighty-eight Buddhist temples that make up the route, pilgrims make their journey together with Kobo Daishi (774-835), the holy miracle-working figure who is at the heart of the pilgrimage.Once seen as a marginal practice, recent media portrayal of the pilgrimage as a symbol of Japanese cultural heritage has greatly increased the number of participants, both Japanese and foreign. In this absorbing look at the nature of the pilgrimage, Ian Reader examines contemporary practices and beliefs in the context of historical development, taking into account theoretical considerations of pilgrimage as a mode of activity and revealing how pilgrimages such as Shikoku may change in nature over the centuries.This rich ethnographic work covers a wide range of pilgrimage activity and behavior, drawing on accounts of pilgrims traveling by traditional means on foot as well as those taking advantage of the new package bus tours, and exploring the pilgrimage's role in the everyday lives of participants and the people of Shikoku alike. It discusses the various ways in which the pilgrimage is made and the forces that have shaped it in the past and in the present, including history and legend, the island's landscape and residents, the narratives and actions of the pilgrims and the priests who run the temples, regional authorities, and commercial tour operators and bus companies.In studying the Shikoku pilgrimage from anthropological, historical, and sociological perspectives, Reader shows in vivid detail the ambivalence and complexity of pilgrimage as a phenomenon that is simultaneously local, national, and international and both marginal and integral to the lives of its participants. Critically astute yet highly accessible, Making Pilgrimages will be welcomed by those with an interest in anthropology, religious studies, and Japanese studies, and will be essential for anyone contemplating making the pilgrimage themselves.\n...more", "genre": ["Cultural", "Japan", "History"], "author": "Ian Reader", "rating": "4.02", "pages": "368"}, {"id": 410766, "title": "Queen of Angels", "blurb": "In this brilliant, evocative novel, Greg Bear takes the reader into a strangely familiar, near-future world -- and shatters our conceptions of perfection, punishment, and the elusive nature of the human soul.

As Kirk Douglas has grown older - he turned ninety in December 2006 - he has become less impetuous and more reflective. In this poignant and inspiring new memoir, Douglas contemplates what life is all about, weighing current events from his present frame of mind while summoning the passions of his younger days.Kirk Douglas is a born storyteller, and throughout Let's Face It he tells wonderful tales and shares favorite jokes and hard-won insights. In the book, he explores the mixed blessings of growing older and looks back at his childhood, his young adulthood, and his storied, glamorous, and colorful life and career in Hollywood. He tells delightful stories of the making of such films as Spartacus, Lust for Life, Champion, The Bad and the Beautiful, and many others. He includes anecdotes about his friends Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall, Ronald Reagan, Ava Gardner, Henry Kissinger, Fred Astaire, Yul Brynner, John Wayne, and Johnny Cash. He reveals the secrets that have kept him and his wife, Anne, happily married for more than five decades, and talks fondly and movingly of times spent with his sons, Michael, Peter, Eric, and Joel, and his grandchildren.Douglas's life has been filled with pain as well as joy. In Let's Face It, he writes frankly for the first time about the tragic death of his son Eric from a drug overdose at age forty-five. Douglas tells what it was like to recover from several near-death episodes, including a helicopter crash, a stroke, and a cardiac event. He writes of his sadness that many of his closest friends are no longer with us; the book includes many moving stories such as one about a regular poker game at Frank Sinatra's house at which he and Anne have been fixtures along with Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, and their wives. Though many of the players are gone, the game continues to this day.In Let's Face It, Douglas reflects on how his Jewish faith has become more and more important to him over the years. He offers strong opinions on everything from anti-Semitism to corporate greed, from racism to Hurricane Katrina, and from the war in Iraq to the situation in Israel. He writes about the importance in his life of the need to improve education for all children and about how we need to care more about the world and less about ourselves.A must-read for every fan, this engrossing memoir provides an indelible self-portrait of a great star - while sharing the wit and wisdom Kirk Douglas has accumulated over a lifetime.", "genre": ["Biography", "Nonfiction", "Memoir", "Autobiography", "Audiobook", "Media Tie In", "Adult"], "author": "Kirk Douglas", "rating": "3.76", "pages": "272"}, {"id": 411754, "title": "DNA: The Secret of Life", "blurb": "DNA: The Secret of Life", "genre": ["Science", "Science", "Biology", "Nonfiction", "Biology", "Genetics", "Biology", "Evolution", "History", "Science", "Popular Science", "Biography", "Science", "Chemistry", "Health", "Medicine"], "author": "James D.

With twin daughters finishing high school, a son at Dartmouth, and a kindergartner from her second marriage, there seems to be no challenge to which Olympia cannot rise. Until one sunny day in May, when she opens an invitation for her daughters to attend the most exclusive coming-out ball in New York-and chaos erupts all around her. One twin's excitement is balanced by the other's outrage; her previous husband's profound snobbism is in sharp contrast to her current husband's flat refusal to attend.For Olympia's husband, Harry, whose parents survived the Holocaust, the idea of a blue-blood debutante ball is abhorrent. Her daughter Veronica, a natural-born rebel, agrees- while Veronica's identical twin, Virginia, is already shopping for the perfect dress. Then there's Olympia's ex, an insufferable snob, who sees the ball as the perfect opportunity for a family feud. And amid all the hubbub, Olympia's college-age son, Charlie, is facing a turning point in his life-and may need his mother more than ever. But despite it all, Olympia is determined to steer her family through the event until, just days before the cotillion, things begin to unravel with alarming speed.From a son's crisis to a daughter's heartbreak, from a case of the chicken pox to a political debate raging in her household, Olympia is on the verge of surrender. And that is when, in a series of startling choices and changes of heart, family, friends, and even a blue-haired teenager all find a way to turn a night of calamity into an evening of magic.

Forty-seven years of joyous celebrations after victories and crushing disappointments after defeats are encompassed in it, but it is about more than just touchdowns and interceptions. It is about how a person like Marv Levy, dedicated to his life's work, can begin his career as the obscure assistant coach of a high school junior varsity team and then one day, decades later, lead his men out onto the field in football's greatest spectacle--the Super Bowl. Readers are invited to come experience what it was like to be on the sidelines and be the winning coach in a game that has been designated as the greatest upset in collegiate football history and then be there again 25 years later when an injury-riddled team, losing 35-3 in the second half, rallies and then miraculously goes on to achieve the greatest comeback victory in the history of the National Football League. Fans will learn what it was like to wallow in the exhilaration that comes from leading a team to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances, only to follow it with the desolation that strikes when all four of those games end in defeat. But they will also learn about the character, persistence, and personalities of those incomparable Buffalo Bills of the 1990s who so resolutely pursued their impossible dream. There will be some laughs and there may be some tears. Readers will meet the people who shaped this coach's life, and they will wind up feeling close to them.

During the summer before the United States entered World War I, when ocean swimming was just becoming popular and luxurious Jersey Shore resorts were thriving as a chic playland for an opulent yet still innocent era's new leisure class, Americans were abruptly introduced to the terror of sharks. In July 1916 a lone Great White left its usual deep-ocean habitat and headed in the direction of the New Jersey shoreline. There, near the towns of Beach Haven and Spring Lake-and, incredibly, a farming community eleven miles inland-the most ferocious and unpredictable of predators began a deadly rampage: the first shark attacks on swimmers in U.S. history. For Americans celebrating an astoundingly prosperous epoch much like our own, fueled by the wizardry of revolutionary inventions, the arrival of this violent predator symbolized the limits of mankind's power against nature.Interweaving a vivid portrait of the era and meticulously drawn characters with chilling accounts of the shark's five attacks and the frenzied hunt that ensued, Michael Capuzzo has created a nonfiction historical thriller with the texture of Ragtime and the tension of Jaws. From the unnerving inevitability of the first attack on the esteemed son of a prosperous Philadelphia physician to the spine-tingling moment when a farm boy swimming in Matawan Creek feels the sandpaper-like skin of the passing shark, Close to Shore is an undeniably gripping saga.Heightening the drama are stories of the resulting panic in the citizenry, press and politicians, and of colorful personalities such as Herman Oelrichs, a flamboyant millionaire who made a bet that a shark was no match for a man (and set out to prove it); Museum of Natural History ichthyologist John Treadwell Nichols, faced with the challenge of stopping a mythic sea creature about which little was known; and, most memorable, the rogue Great White itself moving through a world that couldn't conceive of either its destructive power or its moral right to destroy.Scrupulously researched and superbly written, Close to Shore brings to life a breathtaking, pivotal moment in American history.

His Tales from Ovid was called one of the great works of our century (Michael Hofmann, The Times, London), his Oresteia of Aeschylus is considered the difinitive version, and his Ph\u00e8dre was acclaimed on stage in New York as well as London. Hughes's version of Euripides's Alcestis, the last of his translations, has the great brio of those works, and it is a powerful and moving conclusion to the great final phase of Hughes's career. Euripides was, with Aeschylus and Sophocles, one of the greatest of Greek dramatists. Alcestis tells the story of a king's grief for his wife, Alcestis, who has given her young life so that he may live.

Chaplin thoroughly alters our historical view of the origins of English presumptions of racial superiority, and of the role science and technology played in shaping these notions. By placing the history of science and medicine at the very center of the story of early English colonization, Chaplin shows how contemporary European theories of nature and science dramatically influenced relations between the English and Indians within the formation of the British Empire.In Chaplin's account of the earliest contacts, we find the English - impressed by the Indians' way with food, tools, and iron - inclined to consider Indians as partners in the conquest and control of nature. Only when it came to the Indians' bodies, so susceptible to disease, were the English confident in their superiority. Chaplin traces the way in which this tentative notion of racial inferiority hardened and expanded to include the Indians' once admirable mental and technical capacities. Here we see how the English, beginning from a sense of bodily superiority, moved little by little toward the idea of their mastery over nature, America, and the Indians - and how this progression is inextricably linked to the impetus and rationale for empire.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Nonfiction", "Science"], "author": "Joyce E.

The earliest narrative thread takes place in the Proven\u00e7al region of fifth-century Gaul, when the Roman Empire is crumbling and barbarian hordes are pounding at the gates. In the face of the escalating threat, philosopher/aristocrat Manlius Hippomanes devises a scheme to preserve the essence of the Golden Age of Rome. He also composes a document called The Dream of Scipio, which sets forth in detail his own flawed moral philosophy, a philosophy that resonates throughout the novel.The second thread is set at the height of the plague years in 14th-century Provence, where Olivier de Noyen -- a poet and fanatical collector of ancient manuscripts (one of which is Manlius's Dream of Scipio) -- finds himself caught between the internecine rivalries of the Papacy and his obsessive love for an outcast woman. The final thread takes place in Nazi-occupied Provence, where scholar and historian Julien Barneuve becomes immersed in the intertwined histories of Manlius and de Noyen as he conducts a doomed love affair with a Jewish artist. When he reluctantly serves as a censor and minor administrator for the Vichy government, Barneuve comes face-to-face with the human cost of moral corruption and compromised ideals.The Dream of Scipio is a beautifully constructed, rigorously intelligent novel that brings both the remote and recent past into sharp, precisely detailed focus. Pears brilliantly evokes the politics, passions, and prejudices of three disparate eras and poses difficult questions about personal responsibility and the choices a man must make when his world and way of life come under siege.

Altschuler shows, in particular, how rock'sswitchblade beat opened up wide fissures in American society along the fault-lines of family, sexuality, and race. For instance, the birth of rock coincided with the Civil Rights movement and brought race music into many white homes for the first time. Elvis freely credited blacks withoriginating the music he sang and some of the great early rockers were African American, most notably, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. In addition, rock celebrated romance and sex, rattled the reticent by pushing sexuality into the public arena, and mocked deferred gratification and the obsessionwith work of men in gray flannel suits. And it delighted in the separate world of the teenager and deepened the divide between the generations, helping teenagers differentiate themselves from others. Altschuler includes vivid biographical sketches of the great rock 'n rollers, including ElvisPresley, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Buddy Holly--plus their white-bread doppelgangers such as Pat Boone.Rock 'n roll seemed to be everywhere during the decade, exhilarating, influential, and an outrage to those Americans intent on wishing away all forms of dissent and conflict. As vibrant as the music itself, All Shook Up reveals how rock 'n roll challenged and changed American culture and laid thefoundation for the social upheaval of the sixties.\n...more", "genre": ["Music", "History", "Nonfiction", "Academic", "School", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Culture", "Pop Culture", "Historical", "Academic", "Read For School"], "author": "Glenn C.

And now, dear reader, for your intellectual toilet, here is a little piece of soap. Well handled, we guarantee it will be enough. Let us hold this magic stone.The poet Francis Ponge (1899-1988) occupied a significant and unchallenged place in French letters for over fifty years, attracting the attention and admiration of generations of leading intellectuals, writers, and painters, a notable feat in France, where reputations are periodically reassessed and undone with the arrival of new literary and philosophical schools.Soap occupies a crucial, pivotal position in Ponge's work. Begun during the German occupation when he was in the Resistance, though completed two decades later, it determined, according to Ponge, the form of almost all his postwar writing. With this work, he began to turn away from the small, perfect poem toward a much more open form, a kind of prose poem which incorporates a laboratory or workshop, recounting its own process of coming into being along with the final result. The outcome is a new form of writing, which one could call processual poetry. Ponge's later work, from Soap on, is a very important tool in the questioning and rethinking of literary genres, of poetry and prose, of what is literature.There is a blurring of boundaries between Soap and soap (which was hard to come by during the Resistance and is also, of course, metaphorical for a larger social restitution). Soap contains the sum of Ponge's aesthetics and materialist ethics and his belief in the supremacy of language as it becomes the object of the text. In the words of Serge Gavronsky, this work, perhaps one of the longest running metaphors in literature, slowly unwinds, bubbles in verbal inventions, and finally evaporates, leaving the water slightly troubled, slightly darker, but the hands clean, really clean. . . . Out of murky literary habits, Ponge has devised a way of cleaning his text, and through it, man himself, his vocabulary, and as a consequence, his way of being in the world.", "genre": ["Poetry", "France", "French Literature"], "author": "Francis Ponge", "rating": "4.05", "pages": "104"}, {"id": 418072, "title": "Treasure Island", "blurb": "Masterfully crafted, Treasure Island is a stunning yarn of piracy on the fiery tropic seas -- an unforgettable tale of treachery that embroils a host of legendary swashbucklers, from honest young Jim Hawkins to sinister, two-timing Israel Hands, to evil incarnate, blind Pew.

The irresistible rise of Babylen Tartasky from poet to advertising copywriter followed by the short step to ultimate political power is founded on his smart diagnosis of his country's malaise and his ability to encapsulate his compatriots yearnings in a sharp slogan. This is the new Russia of gangsters, fast-flowing cocaine and the untrammelled free market and it is a very disturbing place indeed, not least because in its rawness is laid bare the anatomy of our own degenerative Western culture. Add a splash of Gucci aftershave and there really is little to tell us apart.As a literary sensation in Russia, with six novels already to his name, Pelevin has clearly touched a nerve with his acute insights into the national psyche. Written with cruel wit concealing an austere compassion, it is Pelevin's peculiar talent to capture the sheer absurdity of the experience of a nation which, in the space of a century, has undergone two convulsive revolutions, won and lost a global empire, conquered space and yet been defeated by its own habits of dependency. Omon Ra, Pelevin's most controlled work to date, is a novel woven around the fundamental Soviet fantasy of the cosmonaut hero, while The Clay Machine Gun concerns a contemporary madman's vivid imaginings of his experiences as an unintentional hero of the Revolution. In Babylon, though, we are tricked by a double fantasy: the narrative segues in and out of virtuosic hallucinatory prose alongside Tartasky's own drug trips while the story itself veers towards ludicrous revelations about where the power in society truly lies.At times the strategy can be exasperating and the ultimate rewards are slightly squandered but along the way there are wonderful jokes and acute analysis. \u00ad-Alex Butterworth", "genre": ["Fiction", "Russia", "Russian Literature", "Contemporary", "Fantasy", "Novels", "Literature"], "author": "Victor Pelevin", "rating": "3.87", "pages": "250"}, {"id": 418158, "title": "Jango", "blurb": "Seeker, Morning Star, and the\u00a0Wildman return in this gripping sequel to Seeker and discover that the mysterious warrior sect they were so desperate to join is not what it appeared to be from the outside.

In this extraordinary, myth-shattering book, many people break their silence for the first time, answering dozens of provocative questions: Why did Jackie marry Onassis? Was it only for the money?How did she react when Onassis resumed his affair with Maria Callas? What was the real reason their marriage fell apart?When Jackie returned to New York, how did she rebuild her future on a tarnished and clouded past?When did Maurice Templesman enter her life, and what role did he play in helping Jackie build her fortune?How did Jackie spend her time during those very private New York years?Much more than a portrait of a famous celebrity, Edward Klein's work captures the essence of a captivating woman whosepassion for wealth was matched only by her deep need for privacy.

From the moment Pop Larkin tells his family that their world is perfick, H. E. Bates transports the reader into the delights of an England where the larger-than-life Pop and Ma, together with their children, squeeze every drop of enjoyment out of life and never let a cloud darken their days. The Larkins may live in a junkyard in rural England, but they never fail to see beauty all around them, and they bring light into the lives of all who come into contact with them, be they tax inspector, vicar, or lord. The charm, comedy, and warmth of these three Larkin books have captured British audiences for over thirty years. The uninhibited exploits of the boisterous and hilarious family will now enchant American readers.

Edited upon historical principles by Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, the multi volume edition will offer more poems and fragments than any previous collective edition, arranged in the order of their first circulation. These texts are followed by the most extensive collations hitherto available and detailed commentaries that describe their contextual origins and subsequent reception. Rejected passages of released poems appear as supplements to those poems, while other poetic drafts that Shelley rejected or left incomplete at his death will be grouped according to either their publication histories or the notebooks in which they survive.Volume One includes Shelley's first four works containing poetry (all prepared for publication before his expulsion from Oxford), as well as The Devil's Walk (circulated in August 1812), and a series of short poems that he sent to friends between 1809 and 1814, including a bawdy satire on his parents and Oh wretched mortal, a poem never before published. An appendix discusses poems lost or erroneously attributed to the young Shelley.These early poems are important not only biographically but also aesthetically, for they provide detailed evidence of how Shelley went about learning his craft as a poet, and the differences between their tone and that of his mature short poetry index a radical change in his self-image...

Certainly the novel boasts a cast of if not thousands, at least dozens of characters ranging from the spirited title character, Cordelia, to a bear named Maude. The story, such as it is, begins in the year 1896 and involves a mysterious inheritance--a parcel of land in the north of Maine that Cordelia's Uncle Basil has left to her. But readers will find themselves less interested in Uncle Basil's bequest than in the kaleidoscope of eccentrics who involve themselves in it. The subtitle of Reid's novel is The Marvelous Beginnings of the Moosepath League, and it is with the formation of this secret club that much of the novel concerns itself. Every character has a story to tell and each fresh tale seems to spawn another; there are balloon ascensions, phantom sailors, mysterious notes, and determined suitors; fortunately, everyone is so charming and their yarns so entertaining that you don't really mind the many, many digressions from the purported main point of the book, namely Cordelia and her inheritance. Set in the 19th century, Cordelia Underwood exhibits some of that century's literary conventions, as well--originally published in serial form in a regional newspaper, it is a sprawling tale populated with singular personalities and intended to entertain.

Roosevelt, as commander in chief, statesman, and politician, must navigate a delicate balance between helping those in Europe--while remaining mindful of the forces of isolation both in the Congress and the country--and protecting the gains of the New Deal, upon which he has spent so much of his prestige and power.Kenneth S. Davis draws vivid depictions of the lives, characters, and temperaments of the military and political personalities so paramount to the history of the time: Churchill, Stalin, de Gaulle, and Hitler; Generals Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur; Admiral Darlan, Chiang Kai-shek, Charles Lindbergh, William Allen White, Joseph Kennedy, Averell Harriman, Harry Tru-man, Robert Murphy, Sidney Hillman, William Knud-sen, Cordell Hull, Henry Morgenthau, Henry Stimson, A. Philip Randolph, Wendell Willkie, and Henry Wallace.The portrait of Henry Hopkins, who interacted with many of these personalities on behalf of Roosevelt, is woven into this history as the complex, interconnected relationship it was. Hopkins burnished the relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt and eased the way for their interactions with Stalin.Another set of characters central to Roosevelt's life and finely drawn by the author includes Eleanor Roo-sevelt, Sara Roosevelt, Missy LeHand, Grace Tully, Princess Martha of Norway, and Daisy Suckley.Integral to this history as well are the Argentina Conference, the Atlantic Charter and the beginnings of the United Nations, the Moscow Conference, lend-lease, the story of the building of the atomic bomb, Hitler's Final Solution and how Roosevelt and the State Department reacted to it, Pearl Harbor and war with Japan, the planning of Torch, and the murder of Admiral Darlan. All these stories intersect with the economic and social problems facing Roosevelt at home as the United States mobilizes for war.The lessons and concerns of 1940-1943 as dissected in this book are still relevant to the problems and concerns of our own time. A recurrent theme is technology: Do people control technology, or does technology control people?Kenneth Davis had the rare gift of writing history that reads with the immediacy of a novel; and though the outcome of this history is well known, the events and people depicted here keep the reader focused on an enthralling suspense story.", "genre": ["History", "Biography", "Presidents"], "author": "Kenneth Sydney Davis", "rating": "3.85", "pages": "848"}, {"id": 419904, "title": "A Year and a Day", "blurb": "Fifteen-year-old Alice dreams of her first kiss, has sleepovers, auditions for Our Town, and tries to pass high school biology.

In a carefully documented expose (which includes some astounding, secretly taped confidential conversations), the authors explore the real Las Vegas-a clever (and profitable) front for organized crime.Everything is legal, of course-everything except mysterious, unreported murders, systematic tax evasion, widespread prostitution, tacit segregation, and the graft that greases the entire system.Why was Bugsy Siegel, the founder of modern Las Vegas, liquidated? Who are some of Frank Sinatra's sinister partners in the Sands Hotel? How large is Jimmy Hoffa's interest in the glittering hotels along the Strip? Guess who some of Senator Barry Goldwater's companions have been on his numerous gambling junkets. And why was the body of a United States Senator who died just before election day preserved in a bathtub full of ice until all the returns were in?Citing irrefutable evidence, the authors expose the ways in which some of the nation's top criminals, under the pretense of operating legitimate businesses, are actually pouring millions of tourist-trade dollars into the coffers of the Mafia. They name the hidden interests who really control the casinos and disclose the hypocrisy and corruption that surround public officials on virtually every level of government.Also explained in detail are the tourist's actual chances of coming away a winner, the various house percentages, the subtle devices used to lure players to the tables-and keep them there. Ironically, the gambling equipment is possibly the only thing in Las Vegas that is really on the level.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Crime", "True Crime", "Historical", "Mystery", "Crime"], "author": "Ed Reid", "rating": "3.50", "pages": "244"}, {"id": 421065, "title": "Little Jordan Ray's Muddy Spud", "blurb": "Crafting a story rooted in his admiration of Lewis Carroll, L.

But he was also the author of half a dozen of the quirkiest, most comic novels in English, a publisher (from his own back bedroom in Kettering) of some of the most eccentric, collectable - and smallest - books ever printed, and an enigmatic, elusive individual.Among Carr's novels are A Month in the Country, his moving story of a World War I survivor that is now a Penguin Classic - which won the Guardian Fiction Award, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and made into a highly successful film starring Kenneth Branagh and Colin Firth; How Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the FA Cup, now published as a Prion Humour Classic and acclaimed as one of the funniest novels ever written about football, and The Harpole Report, acknowledged to be one of the funniest novels ever written about a school. Meanwhile his own self-published Carr's Dictionary of Extraordinary Cricketers became the smallest bestseller ever printed.This biography tells the life story of this fascinating man - a life both surprising and varied, from war service on a West African flying-boat base to a strange interlude teaching in the heart of South Dakota - and discovers a headmaster who would hold arithmetic races on sports day, a mysterious individual who buried all his treasures in his garden and was someone different to everyone who met him, and a novelist whose fiction is partially autobiographical.", "genre": ["Biography"], "author": "Byron Rogers", "rating": "4.08", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 423470, "title": "That's Why They're in Cages, People!", "blurb": "One of the great things about being gay, Perry said in a 2001 interview with Genre, is that it frees you to be different.

The average kitchen, for example, is home to stuff galore, and every appliance, every utensil, every thing, is compound--composed of tens, hundreds, even thousands of other things. Although each piece of stuff satisfies some desire, it also creates the need for even more stuff: cereal demands a spoon; a television demands a remote. Rich Gold calls this dense, knotted ecology of human-made stuff the Plenitude. And in this book--at once cartoon treatise, autobiographical reflection, and practical essay in moral philosophy--he tells us how to understand and live with it.Gold writes about the Plenitude from the seemingly contradictory (but in his view, complementary) perspectives of artist, scientist, designer, and engineer--all professions pursued by him, sometimes simultaneously, in the course of his career. I have spent my life making more stuff for the Plenitude, he writes, acknowledging that the Plenitude grows not only because it creates a desire for more of itself but also because it is extraordinary and pleasurable to create.Gold illustrates these creative expressions with witty cartoons.

But what is the source of authority in dictionaries? Some dictionaries employ panels of experts to fix meaning and prescribe usage, others rely on derivation through etymology. But perhaps no other dictionary has done more to standardize the English language than the formidable twenty-volume Oxford English Dictionary in its 1989 second edition. Yet this most Victorian of modern dictionaries derives its meaning by citing the earliest known usage of words and by demonstrating shades of meaning through an awesome database of over five million examples of usage in context. In this fascinating study, John Willinsky challenges the authority of this imperial dictionary, revealing many of its inherent prejudices and questioning the assumptions of its ongoing revision. Clearly, the OED is no simple record of the language `as she is spoke, ' Willinsky writes. It is a selective representation reflecting certain elusive ideas about the nature of the English language and people. Empire of Words reveals, by statistic and table, incident and anecdote, how serendipitous, judgmental, and telling a task editing a dictionary such as the OED can be.Willinsky analyzes the favored citation records from the three editorial periods of the OED's compilation: the Victorian, imperial first edition; the modern supplement; and the contemporary second edition composed on an electronic database. He reveals shifts in linguistic authority: the original edition relied on English literature and, surprisingly, on translations, reference works, and journalism; the modern editions have shifted emphasis to American sources and periodicals while continuing to neglect women, workers, and other English-speaking countries.Willinsky's dissection of dictionary entries exposes contradictions and ambiguities in the move from citation to definition. He points out that Shakespeare, the most frequently cited authority in the OED, often confounds the dictionary's simple sense of meaning with his wit and artfulness. He shows us how the most famous four-letter words in the language found their way through a belabored editorial process, sweating and grunting, into the supplement to the OED. Willinsky sheds considerable light on how the OED continues to shape the English language through the sometimes idiosyncratic, often biased selection of citations by hired readers and impassioned friends of the language.Anyone who is fascinated with words and language will find Willinsky's tour through the OED a delightful and stimulating experience.

In complex and lucid prose, Nye then moves methodically through the major contemporary fields in philosophy - logic, ethics, epistemology, philosophy of language, and political theory - in order to demonstrate the ways in which contemporary feminist thought is challenging basic presuppositions in each of these fields.

To the 'mathematical' precision of GuEnon's metaphysics, cosmology, and esoteric history, Frithjof Schuon (1907-1998) added a poetic or 'musical' element, inspired by his close relationship to the Divine Feminine. He also presented the spiritual path as a concrete praxis, involving the spiritual virtues and 'stations of wisdom', that was not so prominent in GuEnon's writings. On the other hand, GuEnon's prophetic eschatology, especially in The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, as well as his analysis of the 'counter-tradition', gives him a unexpectedly contemporary 'edge' that is perhaps less prominent in Schuon's more aesthetic approach. RenE GuEnon and Frithjof Schuon illuminate each other, both through their unanimity and the specific points where they differ. Each is almost the only means of taking the other's measure. Questions of who was greater, who more traditional, are finally less interesting than the tremendous vision of human reality and spiritual truth that emerges from their shared role as renewers of traditional metaphysics and religious understanding. Schuon, as the younger man, was in a position to compose an evaluation of his early intellectual master, and in view of his long and illustrious career as an author after GuEnon's death, Schuon's central essay RenE GuEnon: Some Observations is also his profoundly appreciative as well as pointedly critical declaration of independence (though simultaneously a declaration of collegiality) from the man who, more than anyone else in the modern world, opened to him a fundamental view of 'principial' reality.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "Frithjof Schuon", "rating": "3.80", "pages": "80"}, {"id": 424190, "title": "The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero", "blurb": "A symbol for what is not there, an emptiness that increases any number it's added to, an inexhaustible and indispensable paradox.

And without mathematics our understanding of the universe would be vastly impoverished. But where did this nothing, this hollow circle, come from? Who created it? And what, exactly, does it mean? Robert Kaplan's The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero begins as a mystery story, taking us back to Sumerian times, and then to Greece and India, piecing together the way the idea of a symbol for nothing evolved. Kaplan shows us just how handicapped our ancestors were in trying to figurelarge sums without the aid of the zero. (Try multiplying CLXIV by XXIV). Remarkably, even the Greeks, mathematically brilliant as they were, didn't have a zero--or did they? We follow the trail to the East where, a millennium or two ago, Indian mathematicians took another crucial step. By treatingzero for the first time like any other number, instead of a unique symbol, they allowed huge new leaps forward in computation, and also in our understanding of how mathematics itself works. In the Middle Ages, this mathematical knowledge swept across western Europe via Arab traders. At first it was called dangerous Saracen magic and considered the Devil's work, but it wasn't long before merchants and bankers saw how handy this magic was, and used it to develop tools likedouble-entry bookkeeping. Zero quickly became an essential part of increasingly sophisticated equations, and with the invention of calculus, one could say it was a linchpin of the scientific revolution. And now even deeper layers of this thing that is nothing are coming to light: our computers speakonly in zeros and ones, and modern mathematics shows that zero alone can be made to generate everything.Robert Kaplan serves up all this history with immense zest and humor; his writing is full of anecdotes and asides, and quotations from Shakespeare to Wallace Stevens extend the book's context far beyond the scope of scientific specialists. For Kaplan, the history of zero is a lens for looking notonly into the evolution of mathematics but into very nature of human thought. He points out how the history of mathematics is a process of recursive abstraction: how once a symbol is created to represent an idea, that symbol itself gives rise to new operations that in turn lead to new ideas. Thebeauty of mathematics is that even though we invent it, we seem to be discovering something that already exists.The joy of that discovery shines from Kaplan's pages, as he ranges from Archimedes to Einstein, making fascinating connections between mathematical insights from every age and culture. A tour de force of science history, The Nothing That Is takes us through the hollow circle that leads to infinity.\n...more", "genre": ["Science", "Mathematics", "Science", "Nonfiction", "History", "Philosophy", "Science", "Popular Science", "Science", "History Of Science", "Historical", "Mathematics", "Number", "Adult"], "author": "Robert M.

Ground work which may precede the struggle is explored, as well as basic requirements for effectives. Then the focus turns to the initial impact of the nonviolent challenge. Repression is probable. Determined, yet nonviolent, continued resistance is needed to fight it. The opponent's repression may rebound by 'political jiu-jitsu', weakening his power by loss of support and increased resistance. Three main mechanisms by which nonviolent action may produce vitory are examined: conversion (the rarest), accomodation, and nonviolent coercion. Massive noncooperation may paralyze and disintegrate even an oppressive system. All these elements of the dynamics of nonviolent struggle are illustrated with examples. The resisting group itself is also changed: it gains in self-respect, confidence and power. Empowerment of the struggle group, the accompanying strengthening of the non-State institutions, ability to defeat repressive elites, and the extension among the populace of a nonviolent struggle capacity, contribute to long-term social changes by redistributing power.", "genre": ["Politics", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy", "Activism", "Social Justice", "Political Science", "History"], "author": "Gene Sharp", "rating": "4.20", "pages": "480"}, {"id": 425224, "title": "\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062a \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0645", "blurb": "The rubaiyat are a series of poems or 'stanzas' by the famous 12th century Persian atronomer and philosopherThe Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m (Persian: \u0631\u0628\u0627\u0639\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062e\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u200e) is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and numbering about a thousand, attributed to Omar Khayy\u00e1m (1048\u20131131), a Persian poet, mathem\nThe rubaiyat are a series of poems or 'stanzas' by the famous 12th century Persian atronomer and philosopherThe Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m (Persian: \u0631\u0628\u0627\u0639\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062e\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u200e) is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and numbering about a thousand, attributed to Omar Khayy\u00e1m (1048\u20131131), a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer.

Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts in engineering and computer science.This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent system, or a group of robots.

Although women's political participation was curtailed, female allegories of liberty, justice, and the republic played a crucial role in the passage from old regime to modern society. In her lavishly illustrated and gracefully written book, Joan B. Landes explores this paradox within the workings of revolutionary visual culture and traces the interaction between pictorial and textual political arguments. Landes highlights the widespread circulation of images of the female body, notwithstanding the political leadership's suspicions of the dangers of feminine influence and the seductions of visual imagery. The use of caricatures and allegories contributed to the destruction of the masculinized images of hierarchic absolutism and to forging new roles for men and women in both the intimate and public arenas. Landes tells the fascinating story of how the depiction of the nation as a desirable female body worked to eroticize patriotism and to bind male subjects to the nation-state. Despite their political subordination, women too were invited to identify with the project of nationalism. Recent views of the French Revolution have emphasized linguistic concerns; in contrast, Landes stresses the role of visual cognition in fashioning ideas of nationalism and citizenship. Her book demonstrates as well that the image is often a site of contestation, as individual viewers may respond to it in unexpected, even subversive, ways.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Literature", "18th Century", "Cultural", "France"], "author": "Joan B.

Roosevelt, as commander in chief, statesman, and politician, must navigate a delicate balance between helping those in Europe--while remaining mindful of the forces of isolation both in the Congress and the country--and protecting the gains of the New Deal, upon which he has spent so much of his prestige and power.Kenneth S. Davis draws vivid depictions of the lives, characters, and temperaments of the military and political personalities so paramount to the history of the time: Churchill, Stalin, de Gaulle, and Hitler; Generals Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur; Admiral Darlan, Chiang Kai-shek, Charles Lindbergh, William Allen White, Joseph Kennedy, Averell Harriman, Harry Tru-man, Robert Murphy, Sidney Hillman, William Knud-sen, Cordell Hull, Henry Morgenthau, Henry Stimson, A. Philip Randolph, Wendell Willkie, and Henry Wallace.The portrait of Henry Hopkins, who interacted with many of these personalities on behalf of Roosevelt, is woven into this history as the complex, interconnected relationship it was. Hopkins burnished the relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt and eased the way for their interactions with Stalin.Another set of characters central to Roosevelt's life and finely drawn by the author includes Eleanor Roo-sevelt, Sara Roosevelt, Missy LeHand, Grace Tully, Princess Martha of Norway, and Daisy Suckley.Integral to this history as well are the Argentina Conference, the Atlantic Charter and the beginnings of the United Nations, the Moscow Conference, lend-lease, the story of the building of the atomic bomb, Hitler's Final Solution and how Roosevelt and the State Department reacted to it, Pearl Harbor and war with Japan, the planning of Torch, and the murder of Admiral Darlan. All these stories intersect with the economic and social problems facing Roosevelt at home as the United States mobilizes for war.The lessons and concerns of 1940-1943 as dissected in this book are still relevant to the problems and concerns of our own time. A recurrent theme is technology: Do people control technology, or does technology control people?Kenneth Davis had the rare gift of writing history that reads with the immediacy of a novel; and though the outcome of this history is well known, the events and people depicted here keep the reader focused on an enthralling suspense story.From the Hardcover edition.", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Kenneth Sydney Davis", "rating": "4.03", "pages": "Paperback"}, {"id": 425715, "title": "Ellen's Lion", "blurb": "This collection of very short stories chronicles Ellen's relationship - complete with two-way conversations - with her floppy stuffed lion.

Darwin shoes that human mental and emotional capacities, far from making human beings unique, are evidence of an animal origin and evolutionary development. Part Two is an extended discussion of the differences between the sexes of many species and how they arose as a result of selection. Here Darwin lays the foundation for much contemporary research by arguing that many characteristics of animals have evolved not in response to the selective pressures exerted by their physical and biological environment, but rather to confer an advantage in sexual competition.

Popular both on the catwalk and on the street, it made front-page news when worn by Diana, Princess of Wales and by Cherie Booth, the wife of UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.In her ethnography of the local and global design economies established by Asian women fashion entrepreneurs, Parminder Bhachu focuses on the transformation of the salwaar-kameez from negatively coded 'ethnic clothing' to a global garment fashionable both on the margins and in the mainstream. Exploring the design and sewing businesses, shops and street fashions in which this revolution has taken place, she shows how the salwaar-kameez is today at the heart of new economic micro-markets which themselves represent complex, powerfully coded means of cultural dialogue and racial politics. The innovative designs of second-generation British Asian women are drawn from characteristically improvisational migrant cultural codes. Through their hybrid designs and creation of new aesthetics, these women cross cultural boundaries, battling with racism and redefining both Asian and British identities. At the same time, their border-crossing commercial entrepreneurship produces new diaspora economies which give them control over many economic, aesthetic, cultural and technological resources. In this way, the processes of global capitalism are gendered, racialized and localized through the interventions of diasporic women from the margins.\n...more", "genre": ["Couture", "Fashion"], "author": "P.

Comprising a number of often secret but sometimes very influential religious groups in the West and in the Islamic world, it affected mainstream and radical politics in Europe and the development of the field of religious studies in the United States.In the nineteenth century, at a time when progressive intellectuals had lost faith in Christianity's ability to deliver religious and spiritual truth, the West discovered non-Western religious writings. From these beginnings grew Traditionalism, emerging from the occultist milieu of late nineteenth-century France, and fed by the widespread loss of faith in progress that followed the First World War. Working first in Paris and then in Cairo, the French writer Rene Guenon rejected modernity as a dark age, and sought to reconstruct the Perennial Philosophy - the central religious truths behind all the major world religions - largely on the basis of his reading of Hindu religious texts.A number of disenchanted intellectuals responded to Guenon's call with attempts to put theory into practice. Some attempted without success to guide Fascism and Nazism along Traditionalist lines; others later participated in political terror in Italy.

In early August 1757, under the leadership of the Marquis de Montcalm, French forces attacked the fort, and forced a British surrender. Indians attacked retreating British troops on their way to nearby Fort Edward. This attack, known as the \u201cmassacre, \u201d was both memorialized and distorted in James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s The Last of the Mohicans. David R. Starbuck, drawing upon his archeological findings at the site of the fort, offers an engaging and sobering corrective to myths generated by popular depictions of this brutal conflict. Set against a visual backdrop of over 80 historical and contemporary views of the site and its artifacts, he interprets the remains of the tools and weapons of the Native Americans who first settled the region as well as subsequent French and British invaders.

Until then, he did not know that his older brother, Romek, whom the Nazis had tortured to death many years earlier, had been involved in a Polish Underground plot to avert Nazi Germany's ability to create an atomic bomb. When David finally agreed to testify, he began to relive all the horrors of his experiences during the war: concentration camps, murders, tortures, starvation, and disease. When David Faber was 13 years old, he had witnessed the Nazi murders of his parents, brother Romek, and five of his six sisters.

But the real Jane Austen, who started as author at twelve years old, was something very different. What depths of intellectual and moral despair must she have plumbed before she achieved the extraordinary moral vision that has been compared, with justice, to Chaucer's? It was a fortunate thing for her family that the highly polished surface of the six novels, their sheer artistry concealing tension, makes it easy to miss the depth and bitterness of what they are often saying. We must look for real evidence about her character not in the censored reminiscences of Victorian relatives, but in the books and the letters themselves. Jane Aiken Hodge has gone deeply into the novelist's own writings, family and contemporary records to produce a new picture of this enigmatic figure who did so much to revive the English novel at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Jane Austen appears at once as a very warm and human figure (the dear Aunt Jane of the Victorians), and as a baffling one. Did she, in fact, suffer what we should call a nervous breakdown in her silent, middle years? And was she content with her publishers, and with the comparatively modest earnings of her novels? Hodge does not pretend to provide final answers to these and other fascinating questions, but she is meticulous in giving the facts on which readers can base their own conclusions.

While its effect upon the Soviet Union and other nations today is far less than it was while Stalin lived, it is by no means dead.In this landmark volume some of the world's foremost scholars of the subject, in a concerted group inquiry, present their interpretations of Stalinism and its influence on all areas of comparative Communist studies from history and politics to economics, sociology, and literary scholarship. The studies contained in this volume are an outgrowth of a conference on Stalinism held in Bellagio, Italy, sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies.In his major contribution to this book, Leszek Kolakowski calls Stalinism a unified state organism facing atom-like individuals. This extraordinary volume, augmented by a revealing new introduction by the editor, Robert C. Tucker, can be seen as amplifying that remark nearly a half century after the death of Joseph Stalin himself.Contributors to this work are: Wlodzimierz Brus, Katerina Clark, Stephen F.

A young Japanese-American woman, Jackie Ishida, is in her last semester of law school when her grandfather, Frank Sakai, dies unexpectedly. While trying to fulfill a request from his will, Jackie discovers that four African-American boys were killed in the store Frank owned during the Watts Riots of 1965.

Yet Vienna is a society on the edge of chaos. Beneath the glittering surface it seethes with conflict and ethnic tension. Divided by anti-Semitism, racism, feminism, sex, and the denial of sex, it is a society remarkably similar to our own. The Plot: The women of Vienna are dying - some by murder, some by suicide. During Dr. Freud's absence in Paris, a body is found in his study but disappears as quickly as it was discovered. Was there really a murder or was it merely hysteria on the part of Freud's wife and sister-in-law? How does this body fit into the recent epidemic of women's mysterious deaths in Vienna? Into the web of deceit, murder, and social upheaval step a variety of real characters, each with something to hide, who become suspects in the case: the distinguished novelist Edith Wharton, who comes to Vienna to engage in a passionate illicit affair; her friend and traveling companion Henry James, who has consulted Freud about his own secret trespasses; Freud's colleagues Dr. Jung and Dr. Fliess; and Jung's patient-lover, Sabina Spielrein. Drawn into the plot as well are the Mains, the family of an American businessman, along with Police Inspector LeBlanc, who arrives from Paris to pursue the strange case amid mounting anti-Semitic desire to lay blame for the murders at the door of Jews. Will the inspector solve the murders before a riot ensues? The Novel: Is fiction, as Henry James says, just the other side of history? Is Vienna in 1900 merely a stage on which the same tensions that haunt American society today are being given a dress rehearsal? Are we, like the Viennese of 1900, suffering from fin de si\u00e8cle syndrome? Is there such a thing?

Becher points out that under Charlemagne, jury courts were introduced, the laws of the Franks revised and written down, new coinage introduced, weights and measures reformed, and a Frankish grammar begun. Charlemagne tried to give his kingdom a spiritual basis by referring to antique traditions, says Becher, and he explores the tensions that existed in Charlemagne\u2019s court between modern ideas and traditional thinking.

Aristotle was perhaps the first to define this faculty when in his treatise On the Soul he identified a sensory power, irreducible to the five senses, by which animals perceive that they are perceiving: the simple -sense, - as he wrote, -that we are seeing and hearing.- After him, thinkers returned, time and again, to define and redefine this curious sensation. The classical Greek and Roman philosophers as well as the medieval Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin thinkers who followed them all investigated a power they called -the common sense, - which one ancient author likened to -a kind of inner touch, by which we are able to grasp ourselves.- Their many findings were not lost with the waning of the Middle Ages. From Montaigne and Francis Bacon to Locke, Leibniz, and Rousseau, from nineteenth-century psychiatry and neurology to Proust and Walter Benjamin, the writers and thinkers of the modern period have turned knowingly and unknowing to the terms of older traditions in exploring the perception that every sensitive being possesses of its life.The Inner Touch reconstructs and reconsiders the history of this perception. In twenty-five concise chapters that move freely among ancient, medieval, and modern cultures, Daniel Heller-Roazen investigates a set of exemplary phenomena that have played central roles in philosophical, literary, psychological, and medical accounts of the nature of animal existence. Here sensation and self-sensation, sleeping and waking, aesthetics and anesthetics, perception and apperception, animal nature and human nature, consciousness and unconsciousness, all acquire a new meaning.The Inner Touch proposes an original, elegant, and far-reaching philosophical inquiry into a problem that has never been more pressing: what it means to feel that one is alive.Winner of the Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for Comparative Literary Studies\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Daniel Heller-Roazen", "rating": "4.45", "pages": "386"}, {"id": 430394, "title": "True Ghost Stories", "blurb": "Dr. Hans Holzer, the foremost authority on the subject of the paranormal and author of over 100 books, has written a bone-chilling collection of case histories of real hauntings in America.

Forst makes a four-part distinction to decipher the debate between communitarianism and liberalism. These four parts concern the constitution of the self, the neutrality of law, the ethos of democracy, and the opposition between universalism and contextualism.

Sold into prostitution by her stepfather when she was only eleven, Linny clung to the belief that she was meant for something more, something better, than life on the cold, dangerous streets.A stroke of luck granted Linny the chance to re-create herself as a proper middle-class young lady, allowing her to join the fishing fleet -- young women of good birth who sailed to India in search of husbands.

Warner: The first precept I heard from the lips of Arthur Henry King was that an author is revealed by his work. Attitudes, prejudices, morality, commitments-all are unfolded in the works of any given author. At the very least, this expanded and edited volume, which draws upon Arthur Henry King's earlier work, The Abundance of the Heart, reveals the man without being overtly autobiographical. If this work reveals the man, he was a man of firm convictions, of great humility, and of guilelessness. He made the historical, the cultural, the philosophical accessible. In this book, this convert to the LDS faith affirms the life-changing experience of finding the Restoration of the gospel and then draws upon the understanding brought by it to recast the meaning of academic inquiry, tradition, judgment, language, education, effective writing, and wholeness. The depth and breadth of this book is that it is an expression of a man whose way of being in the world unfolds by his reflections on how the restored gospel transforms the meaning of everyday life and of our grand purposes here. Our salvation and our happiness hinge on being persons of commitment to light and truth. The world seems constantly to offer counterfeits to that light. The pure hearted can tell the difference. When those seeking to be pure in heart raise children, teach in homes and schools, are administrators in organizations, or seek to understand art, literature, or language, they see possibilities and understandings to which the worldly are blind. Arthur Henry King offers a light which helps illuminate. One measure of his success is that by the end of the book the reader discovers he or she has been turned not to the author, but to Christ; not to procedures, policies, or rules, but to the grand invitation to see earthly experience by being in the Restoration.", "genre": ["Religion", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Arthur Henry King", "rating": "4.31", "pages": "360"}, {"id": 431247, "title": "Faith of the First Ladies", "blurb": "American presidents and their families are some of the most-watched people in our culture today.

While art historians have wrestled with these images and objects, very few scientists have weighed in on Paleolithic art as artifacts of a complex, living society. R. Dale Guthrie is one of the first to do so, and his monumental volume The Nature of Paleolithic Art is a landmark study that will change the shape of our understanding of these marvelous images.With a natural historian's keen eye for observation, and as one who has spent a lifetime using bones and other excavated materials to piece together past human behavior and environments, Guthrie demonstrates that Paleolithic art is a mode of expression we can comprehend to a remarkable degree and that the perspective of natural history is integral to that comprehension. He employs a mix of ethology, evolutionary biology, and human universals to access these distant cultures and their art and artifacts. Guthrie uses innovative forensic techniques to reveal new information; estimating, for example, the ages and sexes of some of the artists, he establishes that Paleolithic art was not just the creation of male shamans.With more than 3,000 images, The Nature of Paleolithic Art offers the most comprehensive representation of Paleolithic art ever published and a radical (and controversial) new way of interpreting it. The variety and content of these images\u2014most of which have never been available or easily accessible to nonspecialists or even researchers\u2014will astonish you.

In this award-winning biography, Donald R. Howard recreates the public, private, and poetic life of this extraordinary man. Chaucer was born in the latter half of the fourteenth century, an age of revolution and devastation when Europe was convulsed by the Hundred Years' War, the Black Death, and the social and intellectual upheavals that marked the autumn of Feudalism. The son of a wealthy London vintner, he maneuvered his way into the turbulent courts of Edward III and Richard II, and thus, without holding noble rank himself, he was able to witness the violent drama of royal power. It was, as Howard demonstrates, the perfect vantage point for a poet. Chaucer's own poetic development from the mannered medieval style of The Book of the Duchess to the rich, comic, human complexity of the Canterbury Tales reflects the transformation of his world. With the Canterbury Tales and the darker, more formal epic Troilus and Criseyde, Chaucer established English for all time as a language of literature.\n...more", "genre": ["Biography", "History", "Historical", "Medieval", "Nonfiction", "Literature", "Poetry", "History", "Medieval History", "European Literature", "British Literature"], "author": "Donald R.

Inspired by riots in East Germany (1953), and the example of Soviet troop withdrawal leading to Austrian neutrality (1955), there were spontaneous demonstrations by students and workers, mainly in Budapest. When the Hungarian police tried to crush them, Hungarian soldiers joined the insurgents and fought back so effectively that the first Soviet troops sent in were forced to withdraw. After only three years of uneasy power after Stalin's death, the Moscow leadership, including Nikita Kruschev, could not let this pass. After a brief hopeful pause, stronger Soviet forces invaded again in November, including NKVD units, tanks, paratroopers, and troops from non-European republics, who were particularly brutal.Despite tragic radio appeals for NATO troops to intervene, the Suez crisis paralysed the West, though it was persistently rumored that US Special Forces were in place on the Austrian border tasked with capturing a T-55, the latest Soviet tank, if an opportunity arose. The rebels were crushed, and their leaders executed, including Prime Minister Imre Nagy and Defence Minister General Pal Maleter (who had driven his tank into the gates of security police HQ in the first rising). Nearly 200,000 refugees crossed the Austrian border, sparking at least one skirmish between Red Army troops and Austrian border police; but Hungary sank back into the Soviets' icy embrace, until the collapse of the USSR in 1989.New sources and freedoms now allow an interesting re-assessment of 1956 in collaboration with Hungarian academics for this 50th anniversary.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Military", "Military History"], "author": "Erwin A.

One critic, writing upon the publication of the final volume, casually tagged the series as the ultimate work on Dostoevsky in any language, and quite possibly forever.Frank himself had not originally intended to undertake such a massive work. The endeavor began in the early 1960s as an exploration of Dostoevsky's fiction, but it later became apparent to Frank that a deeper appreciation of the fiction would require a more ambitious engagement with the writer's life, directly caught up as Dostoevsky was with the cultural and political movements of mid- and late-nineteenth-century Russia. Already in his forties, Frank undertook to learn Russian and embarked on what would become a five-volume work comprising more than 2,500 pages. The result is an intellectual history of nineteenth-century Russia, with Dostoevsky's mind as a refracting prism.The volumes have won numerous prizes, among them the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, the Christian Gauss Award of Phi Beta Kappa, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the James Russell Lowell Prize of the Modern Language Association.\n...more", "genre": ["Biography", "Cultural", "Russia", "Nonfiction", "History", "Literature", "Literature", "Russian Literature", "Criticism", "Religion", "Biography Memoir", "Literature", "19th Century"], "author": "Joseph Frank", "rating": "4.32", "pages": "424"}, {"id": 434879, "title": "The Well of Tears", "blurb": "The beautiful maiden Jewel is the center of her parent's joy.

What forces and influences shaped Kenyon's writing? And what shaped her as a person and a poet? These are the questions that John Timmerman seeks to answer in Jane Kenyon: A Literary Life. In the opening chapters Timmerman beautifully limns the story of Kenyon's life, drawing on unpublished journals and papers of hers and recollections by her husband, the poet Donald Hall. To show how her art grew out of her life, Timmerman proceeds to explore, volume by volume, the form and substance of Kenyon's work. By frequently examining the multiple drafts that Kenyon wrote in the process of reaching a finished poem, Timmerman reveals how she winnowed and refined ideas, images, and language until a poem was honed to its essence. She was especially interested in the luminous particular, the arresting image that would focus a poem. She also took care to use simple, grounded language and natural objects and events - often drawing on and reflecting on the life she lived at Eagle Pond Farm in rural New Hampshire. Throughout her life Kenyon struggled with depression, but she never let it define her or her work. She also struggled with her faith almost constantly, yet her faith was unrelenting, according to Timmerman, and she still wrote poems of great beauty and spiritual consolation. Her poetry, even when very personal, reached out - and still reaches out - to the reader, establishing that vital thread of human connection. Indeed, as Timmerman says, Kenyon's poems are soundings of the human soul. Kenyon was cut down in the prime of her writing life by leukemia, and Timmerman concludes by exploring Hall's mourning of her death in Without, a wrenching collection of poems. But Kenyon's voice lives on in her work, and Timmerman's insightful, often moving study shows why this unique literary voice continues to touch readers with its beauty, grace, and power.\n...more", "genre": ["Poetry", "Biography", "Biography Memoir"], "author": "John H.

In the first six months of publication 40,000 copies were sold, and it remains one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. The story opens with Mr Utterson the lawyer learning of an inexplicable attack on a young girl by a certain Mr Hyde, who he knows to be a protege of his old friend Henry Jekyll. Deciding to discover more about the matter, he questions those who might know something and finally manages to speak to Hyde himself. Though it sounds like the beginning of a detective story, the reader is already aware that things are deeper than they might appear: those who meet Hyde feel an irrational hatred and are unable to describe him in any detail. And the language of the text itself seems to be hiding something: vague, ambiguous, at times opaque and full of repetitions. Something is going on here, but we're not sure what it is. In the end, after Hyde has committed a murder, a distressed Jekyll locks himself in his study; but when Utterson breaks down the door, he finds not Jekyll but the dead body of Hyde. He also discovers a document which, along with another already acquired from the last two chapters, explains many things - but not all.

Democracies, while wary of these instruments, have benefited significantly from their use, saving lives, treasure, and gaining strategic advantage. As liberal democracies confront the post-Cold War mix of rogue states and non-state actors, such as criminals and terrorists, and weapons of mass destruction and mass disruption, these clandestine arts may prove to be important tools of statecraft, and perhaps trump cards in the twenty-first century.Godson defines covert action as influencing events in other parts of the world without attribution, and counterintelligence as identifying, neutralizing, and exploiting the secret activities of others. Together they provide the capability to resist manipulation and control others to advantage. Counterintelligence protects U.S. military, technological, and diplomatic secrets and turns adversary intelligence to U.S. advantage. Covert action enables the United States to weaken adversaries and to assist allies who may be hampered by open acknowledgment of foreign support.Drawing on contemporary and historical literature, broad-ranging contacts with senior intelligence officials in many countries, as well as his own research and experience as a longtime consultant to the U.S. government, Godson traces the history of U.S. covert action and counterintelligence since 1945, showing that covert action works well when it is part of a well-coordinated policy and when policy makers are committed to succeeding in the long-term. Godson argues that the best counterintelligence is an offensive defense. His exposition of the essential theoretical foundations of both covert action and counterintelligence, supported by historical examples, lays out the ideal conditions for their use, as well as demonstrating why they are so difficult to attain.This book will be of interest to students and general readers interested in political science, national security, foreign policy, and military policy.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Roy Godson", "rating": "3.43", "pages": "384"}, {"id": 437545, "title": "Rifleman Costello: The Adventures of a Soldier of the 95th (Rifles) in the Peninsular & Waterloo Campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars", "blurb": "THE ADVENTURES OF A SOLDIER OF THE 95TH (RIFLES) IN THE PENINSULAR & WATERLOO CAMPAIGNS OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS", "genre": ["History", "Military", "Military History", "Biography", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Edward Costello", "rating": "4.08", "pages": "300"}, {"id": 437585, "title": "Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Religion"], "author": "Thomas Aquinas", "rating": "4.48", "pages": "870"}, {"id": 437604, "title": "A Ship to Remember: The Maine and the Spanish-American War", "blurb": "On February 15, 1898, the Maine blew up in Havana harbor.

In the course of searching for the missing Elvis movie, Kinky explores his own deep, dark past, namely his simultaneous affairs with two women named Judy - Uptown Judy and Downtown Judy, both vixens of a fairly high order (if fuzzy memory serves him right).

Inspired by the Russian Revolution and by their own experiences as leaders of the post-war labour revolt in Canada, they set about to create a new kind of party, one that could lead the fight for workers' power.The new Communist Party, formed between 1919 and 1921, quickly became the largest party on the left, with strong roots and influence in the unions and basic industry. Its members led heroic strikes. They fought for labor unity, and engaged in united electoral activity with other currents in the workers movement. They were in the forefront of the struggle for democratic rights.Ten years later, the party was destroyed. Most of its founding leaders were expelled, and three quarters of its membership dropped out. The Communist Party abandoned the program it had adopted in its early years, and turned its back on its principles.The organization still called itself Communist, but it was now Tim Buck's Party. It had been transformed from a revolutionary party into an agent of the new ruling caste in Moscow. In Canadian Bolsheviks, Ian Angus describes and explains the first attempt to build a Leninist party on Canadian soil, showing why it succeeded so well at first, and why it ultimately failed.

Mills demonstrates how this peculiar and unacknowledged contract has shaped a system of global European domination: how it brings into existence whites and non-whites, full persons and sub-persons, how it influences white moral theory and moral psychology; and how this system is imposed on non-whites through ideological conditioning and violence.The Racial Contract argues that the society we live in is a continuing white supremacist state. Holding up a mirror to mainstream philosophy, this provocative book explains the evolving outline of the racial contract from the time of the New World conquest and subsequent colonialism to the written slavery contract, to the separate but equal system of segregation in the United States. According to Mills, the contract has provided the theoretical architecture justifying an entire history of European atrocity against non-whites, from David Hume's and Immanuel Kant's claims that blacks had inferior cognitive power, to the Holocaust, to the kind of imperialism in Asia that was demonstrated by the Vietnam War. Mills suggests that the ghettoization of philosophical work on race is no accident. This work challenges the assumption that mainstream theory is itself raceless. Just as feminist theory has revealed orthodox political philosophy's invisible white male bias, Mills's explication of the racial contract exposes its racial underpinnings.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Race", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "History", "Sociology", "Social Movements", "Social Justice", "Race", "Anti Racist", "Philosophy", "Theory", "Academic"], "author": "Charles W.

The paintings and drawings he created during this time\u2014of which more than 140 have been assembled from public and private collections for the exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2014mark the height of his artistic development and a turning point in the course of nineteenth-century Western art.

The moving portraits of the Arl\u00e9sienne Mme Ginoux and of the postman Roulin, his wife (La Berceuse), and their family also date from this period, as do the intimate paintings of van Gogh's bedroom in the Yellow House and the study of his wooden chair. A group of self-portraits reflects the artist's changing moods and appearance during these feverish months of work.\tThe volume opens with a prologue comprising five works painted during the months van Gogh worked in Paris prior to his departure for the South. It is followed by five sections that retrace his encounter with the town of Arles, its environs (Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, Montmajour, and the Crau), and the people of the region.

Though culturally and ethnically at odds, perhaps, they call each other friends; working together, playing together, opening their homes and hearts, even when they have every reason not to.Sometimes controversial, sometimes funny, but always thought-provoking, Some of My Best Friends is a timely work on a subject that has yet to be fully explored.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Race", "Writing", "Essays"], "author": "Emily Bernard", "rating": "3.73", "pages": "240"}, {"id": 442132, "title": "Inca Gold", "blurb": "Dirk Pitt is the world's greatest adventure hero -- a man of action who lives by his wits and daring.

But the mayor believes in the power of democracy and rallies his fellow citizens to the polls for the presidential election, only to find hundreds of them turned away for trumped-up reasons. Even sweet old Miss Jackson\u2014not to mention the mayor himself\u2014is denied the vote because her name turns up on a bogus list of felons. The national election hinges on Illinois\u2019s electoral votes and, as a result of the mass disenfranchisement of East St. Louis, a radical right-wing junta led by a dim-witted Texas governor seizes the Oval Office. Prodded by shady black billionaire and old friend John Roberts, Fredericks devises a radical plan of protest: East St. Louis will secede from the Union. Roberts opens an \u201coffshore\u201d bank (albeit in the heart of the U.S.) to finance the newly liberated country, and suddenly East St. Louis becomes the Switzerland of the American heartland, flush with money. It also begins to attract a motley circus of idealistic young militants, OPEC-funded hitmen, CIA operatives, tabloid reporters, and AWOL black servicemen eager to protect and serve the new nation. Problems set in almost immediately: Controversies rage over the name and national anthem of the new country (they decide on the Republic of Blackland with an anthem sung to the tune of the theme from Good Times), and local thug Roscoe becomes a warlord and turns his gang into a paramilitary force. When the U.S. military begins to move in, Fredericks is forced to decide whether his protest is worth taking all the way. Birth of a Nation starts with a scenario drawn from the botched election of 2000 and spins it into a brilliantly absurd work of sharply pointed satire.

Each essay focuses on one or two important documentaries, engaging in questions surrounding ethics, ideology, politics, power, race, gender, and representation -- but always in terms of how they arise out of or are involved in the reading of specific documentaries as particular textual constructions. By closely reading documentaries as rich visual works, this anthology fills a void in the critical writing on documentaries, which tends to privilege production over aesthetic pleasure. As we perceive and comprehend the world through visual media increasingly, understanding the textual strategies by which individual documentaries are organized has become critically important. Together, the essays cover the significant developments in the history of the documentary, from the first commercially released feature, Nanook of the North (1922), to modern independent productions, such as An American Family (1973), Tongues Untied (1989), and Finding Christa (1991), and including important national and stylistic movements and various production contexts from the mainstream to the avant-garde. Seth Feldman places Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera (1929) within the context of constructivism and futurism; Vivian Sobchack discusses the strategies of Bunuel's Las Hurdas (Land without Bread, 1931) in relation to surrealism; and Joanne Hershfield explores Que viva Mexico!

Lionel Trilling observed: It can be said that all prose fiction is a variation on the theme of Don Quixote. Vladmir Nabo-kov wrote: Don Quixote is greater today than he was in Cervantes's womb. [He] looms so wonderfully above the skyline of literature, a gaunt giant on a lean nag, that the book lives and will live through [his] sheer vitality. . . . He stands for everything that is gentle, forlorn, pure, unselfish, and gallant. The parody has become a paragon. And V. S. Pritchett observed: Don Quixote begins as a province, turns into Spain, and ends as a universe. . . . The true spell of Cervantes is that he is a natural magician in pure story-telling.The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

He later claimed to be the most musical of all philosophers. Yet most books on Nietzsche fail to explore the importance of music for his thought.Nietzsche and Music provides the first in-depth examination of the fundamental significance of music for Nietzsche's life and work. Nietzsche's views on music are essential for understanding his philosophy as a whole. Part biography and part critical examination, Georges Li\u00e9bert brilliantly demonstrates that despite failed attempts at a professional career as composer, Nietzsche never fully removed himself from the world of music, but instead, became a composer of philosophy, utilizing the musical form as a template for his own writings and creative thought. Li\u00e9bert's study surveys Nietzsche's opinions about particular composers and compositions, as well as his more theoretical writings on music and its relation to the other arts. He also explores Nietzsche's listening habits, his playing and style of composition, and his many contacts in the musical world, including his controversial and contentious relationship with Richard Wagner. For Nietzsche, music gave access to a realm of wisdom that transcended thought. Music was Nietzsche's great solace; in his last years, it was his refuge from madness.A virtuoso exploration of this little-known but crucial aspect of Nietzsche's life and work, this volume will be of enormous value to scholars of philosophy, music, aesthetics, and literature.", "genre": ["Music", "Philosophy"], "author": "Georges Liebert", "rating": "4.18", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 443247, "title": "Confessions", "blurb": "This volume presents the Latin text of one of the great classics of Christian literature, accompanied by a commentary.

Doch ist dies nicht nur eine Seite der Geschichte? Steht nicht eigentlich der Mensch im Dienste dieser Pflanzen, die ihn durch bestimmte Strategien dazu anhalten, f\u00fcr ihre Verbreitung zu sorgen? Diese originelle These bildet den Eingang zu Michael Pollans Weltbetrachtung aus der Sicht von vier Pflanzen. So wie eine Biene die von ihr best\u00e4ubten Blumen wohl ausschlie\u00dflich als Nahrungsquelle bezeichnen w\u00fcrde, so w\u00e4hnt sich auch der G\u00e4rtner als der wahre Beherrscher seiner Sch\u00fctzlinge -- und \u00fcbersieht dabei, dass er von ihnen auf geradezu geniale Weise manipuliert wurde, bienenflei\u00dfig all sein Streben daran zu setzen, f\u00fcr ihre Erhaltung und Verbreitung zu sorgen. Vier Pflanzen beschreibt Pollman exemplarisch f\u00fcr unsere Begierden, die sie seit Jahrtausenden f\u00fcr ihre Zwecke auszunutzen wissen. Da ist zum einen der Apfel, der uns mit S\u00fc\u00dfe lockt. Die Tulpe protzt mit Bl\u00fctenpracht, und unser Hang zur Sch\u00f6nheit treibt uns Jahr um Jahr auf's Neue, ihre Zwiebeln im Erdreich zu verteilen. Die Marihuanapflanze verf\u00fchrt durch ihre berauschende Wirkung und die Kartoffel wird durch den hohen St\u00e4rkegehalt und Ertrag geradezu zum Machtinstrument. Am letzten Beispiel allerdings diskutiert Pollman auch eine g\u00e4nzlich neue Dimension in unserer Beziehung zur Pflanzenwelt: Durch Genmanipulation domestizieren wir das Erbgut selbst. An die Stelle einer wechselseitigen Beziehung, einer Koevolution zweier Arten, tritt nun die willk\u00fcrliche Herrschaft der einen Seite \u00fcber die andere. Der Journalist und Hobbyg\u00e4rtner Pollmann bietet eine kleine Kulturgeschichte der Pflanzenzucht -- mit viel Liebe zu historischen Zusammenh\u00e4ngen und mit zahllosen Anekdoten aus seinem eigenen g\u00e4rtnerischen Alltag. Hinrei\u00dfend komisch sind seine eigenen Erfahrungen im Marihuanaanbau. Intelligente Gedankeng\u00e4nge und eine geh\u00f6rige Portion Erde an den H\u00e4nden machen dieses Buch zu einer ebenso unterhaltsamen wie faszinierenden Lekt\u00fcre -- und \u00f6ffnen die Augen f\u00fcr eine erfrischend andere Sicht der Welt. --Birgit Will\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Science", "Food and Drink", "Food", "Environment", "Nature", "History", "Science", "Biology", "Environment", "Horticulture", "Gardening", "Nature", "Plants", "Health"], "author": "Michael Pollan", "rating": "4.06", "pages": "376"}, {"id": 445646, "title": "Minnie and Moo Save the Earth [With Cassette]", "blurb": "While relaxing in the farmer's hot tub, two cow friends unknowingly thwart analien invasion and save the planet.", "genre": ["Space", "Childrens"], "author": "Denys Cazet", "rating": "3.79", "pages": "Paperback"}, {"id": 445658, "title": "Operation Luna", "blurb": "Poul Anderson, recently the winner of the Nebula's Grandmaster Award for lifetime achievement, returns to the world of his acclaimed novel Operation Chaos with the tale of one family's mission to the moon.

Lena and her Pima Indian partner Jimmy Sisiwan at first suspect the art dealer's abusive husband, but their investigations soon reveal that domestic violence was hardly the only problem in the victim's troubled life.Clarice, for all her money and beauty, had a dark side; her enemies far outnumbered her friends. Among those who wished her dead are George Haozous, the fiery Apache artist whose graphic work she once banned from her gallery. Another enemy is Dulya Albundo, the daughter of an elderly Hispanic woman whose death was directly attributable to the art dealer's greed. Even Clarice's parents--wealthy land developers whose housing tracts have ravaged the beautiful Sonoran Desert--appear to be oddly untroubled by their daughter's death.Lena's search for Clarice's killer brings violence back into her own life, yet it also brings her closer to the solution of her own mystery--her real identity.Set against the backdrop of the posh Scottsdale, Arizona art scene and the nearby Indian reservations, Desert Noir heralds the debut of a detective as wounded as her clients, a woman battling her owndemons while trying to rescue others from theirs.Compare her to J.A.

Set in an insane asylum, The Innocence of the Devil is a complex and chilling novel that recasts the relationships of God and Satan, of good and evil. Intertwining the lives of two young women as they discover their sexual and emotional powers, Saadawi weaves a dreamlike narrative that reveals how the patriarchal structures of Christianity and Islam are strikingly similar: physical violation of women is not simply a social or political phenomenon, it is a religious one as well. While more measured in tone than Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses, Saadawi's novel is similar in its linguistic, literary, and philosophical richness. Evoking a world of pain and survival that may be unfamiliar to many readers, it speaks in a universal voice that reaches across cultures and is the author's most potent weapon. Author Biography: Nawal ElSaadawi is an Egyptian feminist, socialist, medical doctor, and writer. Her works include The Hidden Face of Eve (1982) and Memoirs from the Women's Prison (California, 1994). Sherif Hetata, who is married to Saadawi, is a physician and writer who spent thirteen years in prison for speaking out against the Egyptian government. Fedwa Malti-Douglas is Martha C.

Making their way through the heat \nIt is the Great Fire of 1666. The imposing edifice of St. Paul's Cathedral, a landmark of London since the twelfth century, is being reduced to rubble by the flames that engulf the City.In the holocaust, Pegge and a small group of men struggle to save the effigy of her father, John Donne, famous love poet and the great Dean of St. Paul's. Making their way through the heat and confusion of the streets, they arrive at Paul's wharf. Pegge's husband, William Bowles, anxiously scans the wretched scene, suddenly realizing why Pegge has asked him to meet her at this desperate spot.The story behind this dramatic rescue begins forty years before the fire. Pegge Donne is still a rebellious girl, already too clever for a world that values learning only in men, when her father begins arranging marriages for his five daughters, including Pegge. Pegge, however, is desperate to taste the all-consuming desire that led to her parents' clandestine marriage, notorious throughout England for shattering social convention and for inspiring some of the most erotic and profound poetry ever written. She sets out to win the love of Izaak Walton, a man infatuated with her older sister.Stung by Walton's rejection and jealous of her physically mature sisters, the boyish Pegge becomes convinced that it is her own father who knows the secret of love. She collects his poems, hoping to piece together her parents' history, searching for some connection to the mother she barely knew.Intertwined with Pegge's compelling voice are those of Ann More and John Donne, telling us of the courtship that inspired some of the world's greatest poetry of love and physical longing. Donne's seduction leads Ann to abandon social convention, risk her father's certain wrath, and elope with Donne. It is the undoing of his career and the two are left to struggle in a marriage that leads to her death in her twelfth childbirth at age thirty-three.In Donne's final days, Pegge tries, in ways that push the boundaries of daughterly behaviour, to discover the key to unlock her own sexuality. After his death, Pegge still struggles to free herself from an obsession that threatens to drive her beyond the bounds of reason. Even after she marries, she cannot suppress her independence or her desire to experience extraordinary love.Conceit brings to life the teeming, bawdy streets of London, the intrigue-ridden court, and the lushness of the seventeenth-century English countryside. It is a story of many kinds of love \u2014 erotic, familial, unrequited, and obsessive \u2014 and the unpredictable workings of the human heart. With characters plucked from the pages of history, Mary Novik's debut novel is an elegant, fully-imagined story of lives you will find hard to leave behind.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Literature", "17th Century", "Historical", "Cultural", "Canada", "Literature", "Canadian Literature", "European Literature", "British Literature", "Romance", "Literary Fiction", "Unfinished"], "author": "Mary Novik", "rating": "3.39", "pages": "402"}, {"id": 446514, "title": "Pintores Cubistas", "blurb": "Guillaume Apollinaire's only book on art, The Cubist Painters, was first published in 1913.

He examines Apollinaire's art criticism, his relationship to the Cubist movement, and, more specifically, the genesis of Cubist Painters through its various revisions and proofs.

Victoria Woodhull's Brave New World was to be terrifyingly real. As the first female Wall Street brokers, Victoria Woodhull and her sister Tennie had reputations to protect. They fretted about Tennie's well-publicized remark, Many of the best men in [Wall] Street know my power. Commodore Vanderbilt knows my power. She had meant her skill as a fortune teller, but the press quite rightly picked up hints the attractive pair traded sexual favors for assistance in their business. To make matters worse, in their magazine the sisters had published articles promoting free love, while distancing themselves from what was said. Taking the offensive, Victoria moved, step by step, until in a speech on November 20, 1871, she boldly proclaimed: And to those who denounce me for this I reply: 'Yes, I am a Free Lover. I have an inalienable, constitutional, and natural right to love whom I may, to love as long or as short a period as I can; to change that love every day if I please, and with that right neither you nor any law can frame any right to interfere.' Having come out of the closet, she had to defend that lifestyle from those who warned that it meant social ruin. In speeches across the country, she championed a new society that, in its nineteenth-century context, was remarkable similar to Huxley's 1932 classic, Brave New World. Babies were not grown in bottles, but pregnant women were to be treated as laboring for society, paid the highest wages, and once the baby was weaned, the fruit of her labor will of right belong to society and she return to her common industrial pursuits. To critics who warned that free love meant children growing up without parents, she replied that, not more than one in ten mothers was competent, and that parents should be replaced by the State because, It is but one step beyond compulsory education to the complete charge of children.

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives lickings from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn \u00ad the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a tattle-tale.  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get engaged by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been engaged previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:TOM! No answer. TOM! No answer.

During the early colonial era, Australia's Aborigines often warned British settlers to beware of huge, ape-like creatures that lurked in the rugged mountains and deep forests of the island continent. Their people, they said, had been encountering the hairy horrors since time immemorial. They knew them by many names, including doolagarl, thoolagarl, jurrawarra and tjangara. Soon the colonists, too, began to experience hair-raising encounters with the hulking, foul-smelling creatures, which they referred to as Australian apes, yahoos or youries. Today, they are generally referred to as yowies. The list of modern-day eyewitnesses includes zoologists, rangers, surveyors and members of the elite Special Air Service Regiment. This book chronicles the yowie saga from the pre-colonial era to the present day. It contains over 300 carefully documented eyewitness reports and a vast amount of other data, much of which suggests that the damnably elusive creatures really do exist.

Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris interest Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.", "genre": ["History", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "American History", "Presidents", "Politics", "Historical"], "author": "David McCullough", "rating": "4.06", "pages": "751"}, {"id": 448542, "title": "Great Detectives: A Century of the Best Mysteries from England and America", "blurb": "For enthralling suspense and brilliant detection, there has never been a collection to match this one, with complete novels by Ross Macdonald and Ruth Rendell, a novella by Israel Zangwill, and sixteen short stories by the best mystery writers from England and America\u2014Dorothy Sayers, G.K.

The editors then present a variety of Polish voices grappling with the role of the massacre and of Polish-Jewish relations in Polish history. They include samples of the various strategies used by Polish intellectuals and political elites as they have attempted to deal with their country's dark past, to overcome the legacy of the Holocaust, and to respond to Gross's book.The Neighbors Respond makes the debate over Neighbors available to an English-speaking audience--and is an excellent tool for bringing the discussion into the classroom.

Depictions of race, class, and sexuality seen in P. T. Barnum's museums, in the image of the Circassian Beauty, and in popular periodicals like Harper's Weekly, the Southern Illustrated News, and the San Francisco Golden Era further illustrated who was - and who was not - an American. Local coverage of Native Americans and Chinese in the West, African Americans and recent Irish immigrants in New York, and slaves and Yankees in the South played a major role in conflating Americanness with whiteness. These ideas were shaped by reactions to events such as the 1863 Draft Riots and the Dakota uprising in Minnesota in 1862, and laid bare through the demonization of Northern whites in Confederate newspapers and anxieties expressed in California newspapers about the possibility of Chinese immigrants gaining U.S. citizenship. Through close readings of specific articles published in regional periodicals, mostly unexamined by literary scholars, Frost shows how Americanness came to be defined in the mid-nineteenth century by the mainstream popular culture. The era's many social upheavals - Emancipation, Reconstruction, the start of the Indian wars in the West, immigration, and the completion of the transcontinental railroad - sharpened the desire of Americans to feel part of a national community, even as they made this search for an American identity extremely contentious and necessarily fragmented. Never One Nation provocatively reframes the discourse on racial formation and reveals how local cultures and prejudices can recast the identity of a nation.", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Linda Frost", "rating": "3.15", "pages": "264"}, {"id": 449478, "title": "A...

With a career that began over thirty years ago at Cambridge University, he has managed to do more than perhaps any other scientist to broaden our basic understanding of the universe. His theoretical work on black holes and his progress in advancing our knowledge of the origin and nature of the cosmos have been groundbreakinga if not downright revolutionary.Stephen Hawking has also spent much of his adult life confined to a wheelchair, a victim of ALS, a degenerative motor neuron disease. Clearly his physical limitations have done nothing to confine him intellectually. He simply never allowed his illness to hinder his scientific development. In fact, many would argue that his liberation from the routine chores of life has allowed him to focus his efforts more keenly on his science.Hawking certainly would have been remarkable for his cutting edge work in theoretical physics alone. However, he has also managed to popularize science in a way unparalleled by other scientists of his stature. He became a household name, achieving almost cult-like fame, with the release of his best-selling book, A Brief History of Time. Although steeped in the potentially overwhelming complexities of cosmology, he succeeded in selling millions of copies to audiences eager to learn even some of what he has to offer.Science writers White and Gribbin have skillfully painted a portrait of an indefatigable genius and a scientific mind that seemingly knows no bounds. Knitting together clear explanations of Hawkinga (TM)s science with a detailed personal history that is both balanced as well as sensitive, we come to knowa and appreciatea both.As Stephen Hawkinga (TM)s new book, The Universe in a Nutshell,  hits the best-seller lists, it is the ideal time for readers to learn more about this remarkable man and his vast body of accomplishments.\n...more", "genre": ["Science", "Biography", "Nonfiction", "Science", "Physics", "History", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Science", "Astronomy", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Space"], "author": "Michael  White", "rating": "3.80", "pages": "360"}, {"id": 449555, "title": "Perspectives on Health and Human Rights", "blurb": "This anthology of articles collected by a cast of award-winning scholars in the field of public health illustrates that promoting and protecting human rights is fundamental to promoting and protecting health.

A so-called New York Intellectual, he edited Partisan Review for seven years. Many still consider Macdonald's consistently provocative journal Politics to be the best independent journal of opinion ever published in America.These interviews, including one conducted by Diana Trilling, span the years 1960 to 1980. They show the wide and penetrating scope of Macdonald's interests--Trotskyism, anarchism, pacifism, literature, culture, education, the Holocaust and totalitarianism, film criticism, and anti-Vietnam War protest.As a left-of-center thinker who could be both radical and conservative, Macdonald was intellectually equipped to engage in controversy and debate. He had an instinctive grasp of the significant fact and an uncanny ability to bring the issues before the public in marvelously precise and witty prose. His instinct for exposing cant and hypocrisy and his consistent candor have reminded many of George Orwell.Macdonald decried the demise of literary and artistic standards and of the cheapening and vulgarizing of society. Thus, to his misfortune, postmodern critics too often classify this outspoken, extraordinary thinker as a cultural elitist or at best as a traditionalist. One of his unrelenting concerns was what now is called the dumbing down of America. Appalled at the spreading ooze, he frowned upon America's eagerness to embrace mass culture and popular culture, terms he is credited with coining.In his view, the corruption of language and the commodification of art and literature were a great threat to society. For him, choosing the right word was not only an aesthetic matter. It was a moral choice.Michael Wreszin is a professor emeritus at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

The most famous American of his time, Andrew Jackson is a seminal figure in American history. The first common man to rise to the presidency, Jackson embodied the spirit and the vision of the emerging American nation; the term Jacksonian democracy is embedded in our national lexicon. With the sweep, passion, and attention to detail that made The First American a Pulitzer Prize finalist and a national bestseller, historian H.W. Brands shapes a historical narrative that's as fast-paced and compelling as the best fiction. He follows Andrew Jackson from his days as rebellious youth, risking execution to free the Carolinas of the British during the Revolutionary War, to his years as a young lawyer and congressman from the newly settled frontier state of Tennessee. As general of the Tennessee militia, he put down a massive Indian uprising in the South, securing the safety of American settlers, and his famous rout of the British at the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812 made him a national hero. But it is Jackson's contributions as president, however, that won him a place in the pantheon of America's greatest leaders. A man of the people, without formal education or the family lineage of the Founding Fathers, he sought as president to make the country a genuine democracy, governed by and for the people. Jackson, although respectful of states' rights, devoted himself to the preservation of the Union, whose future in that age was still very much in question. When South Carolina, his home state, threatened to secede over the issue of slavery, Jackson promised to march down with 100,000 federal soldiers should it dare. In the bestselling tradition of Founding Brothers and His Excellency by Joseph Ellis and of John Adams by David McCullough, Andrew Jackson is the first single-volume, full-length biography of Jackson in decades. This magisterial portrait of one of our greatest leaders promises to reshape our understanding of both the man and his era and is sure to be greeted with enthusiasm and acclaim.", "genre": ["Biography", "History", "Presidents", "Nonfiction", "American History", "Politics", "Us Presidents"], "author": "H.W.

His interest in Texas coincided with the strategic goal of Sam Houston, the president of the young Texas Republic, to create a buffer zone between the areas of Anglo settlement and Mexico. History has until now hidden how close the ambitions of these two men came to carving out a Mormon Kingdom of God in the Republic of Texas.In 1844 Smith and his followers were received with political jealousy, religious suspicions, and distaste by their neighbors in Nauvoo, Illinois. Smith looked outside the United States for both refuge and empire. Times were difficult for Texas president Sam Houston, as well. Texas faced the wrath of the Comanches on the western frontier and of Santa Anna on the disputed southern border. To make matters worse, the U.S. Congress was balking on the annexation issue. Houston was desperate, in debt, and looking for assistance from England, France, or perhaps even the Mormons. Smith appointed an ambassador to the Texas Republic, and secret negotiations began in earnest.According to Mormon records, Houston agreed to sell Smith a disputed strip of land between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. Before the Mormon leader could take further action, however, he was murdered by a mob in Illinois. In the leadership succession crisis that ensued, the negotiations were abandoned.Yet, the secret negotiations cannot be seen as a total failure. Houston remained a friend to the Mormons throughout his political career and was later instrumental in ending the Utah War of 1857\u201358. In addition, a group of Mormon settlers emigrated to the Texas Republic on the eve of statehood and became an important part of the Texas cultural mosaic.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Religion"], "author": "Michael Scott Van Wagenen", "rating": "3.56", "pages": "136"}, {"id": 450714, "title": "The Barber of Natchez", "blurb": "In The Barber of Natchez,  Edwin Adams Davis and William Ransom Hogan tell the remarkable story of William Johnson, a slave who rose to freedom, business success, and high community standing in the heart of the South--all before 1850.

Local Justice offers the first systematic analysis of the principles and procedures used in dispensing local justice in situations as varied as the admission of students to college, the choice of patients for organ transplants, the selection of workers for layoffs, and the induction of men into the army. A prominent theorist in the field of rational choice and decision making, Jon Elster develops a rich selection of empirical examples and case studies to demonstrate the diversity of procedures used by institutions that mete out local justice. From this revealing material Elster fashions a conceptual framework for understanding why institutions make these crucial allocations in the ways they do.Elster's investigation discloses the many complex and varied approaches of such decision-making bodies as selective service and adoption agencies, employers and universities, prison and immigration authorities. What are the conflicting demands placed on these institutions by the needs of applicants, the recommendations of external agencies, and their own organizational imperatives? Often, as Elster shows, methods of allocation may actually aggravate social problems. For instance, the likelihood that handicapped or minority infants will be adopted is further decreased when agencies apply the same stringent screening criteria\u2014exclusion of people over forty, single parents, working wives, and low-income families\u2014that they use for more sought-after babies.Elster proposes a classification of the main principles and procedures used to match goods with individuals, charts the interactions among these mechanisms of local justice, and evaluates them in terms of fairness and efficiency. From his empirical groundwork, Elster builds an innovative analysis of the historical processes by which, at given times and under given circumstances, preferences become principles and principles become procedures. Local Justice concludes with a comparison of local justice systems with major contemporary theories of social justice\u2014utilitarianism, John Rawls's A Theory of Justice,\u00a0Robert Nozick's Anarchy,\u00a0State, and Utopia\u2014and discusses the common-sense conception of justice held by professional decision makers such as lawyers, economists, and politicians. The difference between what we say about justice and how we actually dispense it is the illuminating principle behind Elster's book.A perceptive and cosmopolitan study,\u00a0Local Justice is a seminal work for all those concerned with the formation of ethical policy and social welfare\u2014philosophers, economists, political scientists, health care professionals, policy makers, and educators.", "genre": ["Social Science", "Philosophy"], "author": "Jon Elster", "rating": "3.43", "pages": "293"}, {"id": 452770, "title": "The Drifter", "blurb": "A PROPER LADY SHOULD NEVER GIVE HER HEART TO A DRIFTIN' MAN!\tMistress of decorum, Julia Bennett wrote the book on etiquette.

As Carroll ( Bones of the Moon ; Sleeping in Flame ) himself says, Life has a habit of turning dark corners. Applied here, this observation seems an understatement: these convoluted corners are both light and dark, are many, varied and constantly challenging. Flashing back and forth in time, the story concerns the apparent suicide of filmmaker Philip Strayhorn, whose bizarre Midnight series has attained cult status. Strayhorn's best friend, Weber Gregston, a filmmaker with a more intellectual bent, is drawn into a dizzying series of events by a videotape that Philip leaves him. The wickedly imaginative twists and turns that follow are only one facet of this intriguing tale, which seems at times like a framework on which to hang a myriad of metaphysical notions. What, for instance, is one to make of a tattoo of a crow that comes alive in an airplane lavatory? Carroll's style is elegant; his writing is by turns disturbing, fey, sardonic, grim--frequently within a single paragraph.

No convincing explanation has yet been given for the negative image of a crucified man transferred to a length of cloth and preserved in Turin for the last four centuries. Although radiocarbon dating of the fabric in 1988 indicated it to be medieval, synchronous with the Shroud's first recorded appearance in the 1350s, there is still no satisfactory explanation for the image itself. Was it painted? If so, by whom? How could the artist have understood perspective before this technique was discovered in the Renaissance? How could he have painted an image in negative with no means to see and check it? With so many questions about the Shroud as inexplicably unresolved as ever; with the radiocarbon dating findings only deepening the riddle, not solving it; and with the Shroud about to be shown again, in 1998 and 2000; an overview and an up-to-date consideration of the evidence is overdue. Here, Ian Wilson returns to the subject of his international bestseller, The Shroud of Turin,  to reveal such startling findings as the discovery of human blood and DNA on the Shroud; the uncovering of historical evidence that something very like the Shroud existed at the time Jesus lived; the discovery of a bioplastic coating of living microorganisms which, if it had been carbondated in 1988, would have indicated that the Shroud was some one thousand years older than it was thought to be; and the new analysis of the photographic-negative-like image on the Shroud.Wilson's landmark book on this subject, The Shroud of Turin,  was published in 1978. In the intervening twenty years, in addition to the radiocarbon dating, muchadditional research has been done on the Shroud, and the dating process itself scrutinized. Ian Wilson's pursuit of every discipline related to the Shroud, including art history, physiology, chemistry, microbiology, photography, and archaeology, has equipped him to give the most authoritative answer yet to the question: Did the Shroud wrap the body of Christ? His enthralling text, with its objective but persuasive answers, tells us as much as it is currently possible to know.

When two newspapers asked Levitt to look into the murder Levitt soon uncovered groundbreaking information about what had happened that night and subsequently, in the police investigation. But for years, Levitt's superiors mysteriously refused to publish the stories. Convinced that the Moxley family deserved peace and closure at last, Levitt refused to give up. Finally, after Levitt's first article appeared, the case was reopened. Frank Garr, a seasoned Greenwich detective, was appointed investigator on the Moxley case. He pursued unexplored leads and became increasingly convinced that for over a decade, his colleagues had been pursuing the wrong suspects. At first mistrustful of one another, Levitt and Garr became friends, encouraging each other in their quest for the truth as the obstacles against them piled up.

Subsequently, the graphic suffering of the crucified in images and narrative has served to unleash a prolonged sacrificial crisis in which there is always a potential need to displace blame. These doctrines of atonement have sanctioned wide-spread violence in the name of Christ throughout history. But Bartlett argues that a minority tradition also exists. He contends that the tradition of the compassion of Christ provides the possible way out of Christian violence. Bartlett's study gives this tradition a dynamic new reading, showing how it undoes both divine and human violence and offers a powerfully transformative version of atonement for the contemporary world. Cross Purposes provides a rich historical and theological overview of the evolution of various atonement theories, using literature, art, and philosophy to provide a creative and provocative reading of Christian atonement.Anthony Bartlett is engaged in post-doctoral research and is an instructor in Religion at Syracuse University.For: Seminarians; clergy; graduate students; professors", "genre": ["Theology"], "author": "Anthony Bartlett", "rating": "3.67", "pages": "288"}, {"id": 454924, "title": "The Death Christ Died", "blurb": "The resurgence of covenant Reformed theology raises again the long-standing debate concerning the extent of the atonement-limited or unlimited?

Born to radical intellectuals. Mary grew up during Britain's High Romantic Era. which was captured in the feverish visions of William Blake. the fire and brimstone epics of Milton, and the exquisite laudanum-laced poetics of Keats, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The daughter of independent thinkers -- famed feminist and author Mary Wollstonecraft and philosopher novelist William Godwin -- Mary was taught to embrace the original, the daring, and the unfamiliar, all of which inspired her ground-breaking debut novel, Frankenstein.Mary's own life was the very stuff of gothic romance. Conceived in secrecy in a forbidden romance, she was born during a violent storm and, following her mother's death, made daily visits to her grave and learned to read by tracing the inscription on the mossy gravestone.At just 16 Mary ran away with the rebel poet Shelley. Shockingly, they lived together out of wedlock: he was already married to a woman who committed suicide by drowning. Cast out of society, and abandoned by her once doting father, Mary followed her passions. At age 19 she attended a Fateful party hosted by Lord Byron where he challenged his guests -- the literary brat pack of the day -- to compose a ghost story. While the men quickly lost interest in the project, Mary created Frankenstein, a work that would change the face of English literature.To young adult readers of today, Mary Shelley provides equal doses of inspiration and bone-tingling entertainment.

Policymakers and scholars from a variety of disciplines analyze the plight of the urban poor since the riots of the 1960s and the resulting 1968 Kerner Commission Report on the status of African Americans. In essays addressing health care, education, welfare, and housing policies, the contributors reassess the findings of the report in light of developments over the last thirty years, including the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Some argue that the long-standing obstacles faced by the urban poor cannot be removed without revitalizing inner-city neighborhoods; others emphasize strategies to break down racial and economic isolation and promote residential desegregation throughout metropolitan areas. Guided by a historical perspective, the contributors propose a new combination of economic and social policies to transform cities while at the same time improving opportunities and outcomes for inner-city residents. This approach highlights the close links between progress for racial minorities and the overall health of cities and the nation as a whole.

Tomorrow's leaders will have to be facilitators who work collaboratively to help others develop their potential, and this will require emotionally intelligent skills and attitudes. Against this landscape, Applied EI provides the tools and advice needed to develop and manage a relationship with yourself and create positive relationships with others - the twin cornerstones of emotional intelligence. We're all capable of acting with emotional intelligence. Most of us don't, because internal interferences - misguided beliefs and attitudes learnt in childhood - get in the way. Countering this, Applied EI attaches unique importance to the role of attitudes in developing and applying emotional intelligence. Tim Sparrow and Amanda Knight stress that EI isn't a synonym for personality; it's about managing personality. That's why knowing how to put EI into practice is essential. And that's why reducing EI to a single number or score misses the point, and serves only to give us another measure by which to judge ourselves and others.Anyone interested in performance improvement today needs to be interested in emotional intelligence. Applied EI shows how our attitudes underpin our EI, explores how to develop emotionally intelligence attitudes, and lays out tactics for applying them in practice. It discusses what is needed at individual, team and leadership development levels, and considers what it means to be an EI practitioner. Its practical approach and unique perspective make it a must-read for anyone involved in the field of personal development.\n...more", "genre": ["Self Help", "Personal Development"], "author": "Tim Sparrow", "rating": "4.20", "pages": "328"}, {"id": 455456, "title": "The Complete Works of Francis A.

But unfortunately, these characters are real and their stories are true. In August 1996, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb stunned the world with a series of articles in the San Jose Mercury News reporting the results of his year-long investigation into the roots of the crack cocaine epidemic in America, specifically in Los Angeles. The series, titled Dark Alliance, revealed that for the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to Los Angeles street gangs and funneled millions in drug profits to the CIA-backed Nicaraguan Contras. Gary Webb pushed his investigation even further in his book, Dark Alliance: The CIA, The Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion. Drawing from then newly declassified documents, undercover DEA audio and videotapes that had never been publicly released, federal court testimony, and interviews, Webb demonstrates how our government knowingly allowed massive amounts of drugs and money to change hands at the expense of our communities.  Webb's original article spurred an immediate outcry. Within days of publication, both of California's senators made formal requests for investigations of the U.S. government's relationship with the cocaine ring. As a result, public demonstrations erupted in L.A., Washington D.C., and New York. Then-chief of the CIA, John Deutsch, made an unprecedented attempt at crisis control by going to South Central L.A. to hold a public forum. Representative Maxine Waters later said in George magazine, I was shocked by the level of corruption and deceit and the way the intelligence agencies have knowledge of big-time drug dealing. The allegations in Webb's story blazed over the Internet and the Mercury News' website on the series was deluged with hits\u2014over a million in one day. A Columbia Journalism Review cover story called it the most talked-about piece of journalism in 1996 and arguably the most famous\u2014some would say infamous\u2014set of articles of the decade. Webb's own stranger-than-fiction experience is also woven into the book. His excoriation by the media\u2014not because of any wrongdoing on his part, but by an insidious process of innuendo and suggestion that in effect blamed Webb for the implications of the story\u2014had been all but predicted. Webb was warned off doing a CIA expose by a former Associated Press journalist who lost his job when, years before, he had stumbled onto the germ of the Dark Alliance story. And though Internal investigations by both the CIA and the Justice Department eventually vindicated Webb, he had by then been pushed out of the Mercury News and gone to work for the California State Legislature Task Force on Government Oversight. He died in 2004.  The updated paperback edition of Dark Alliance features revelations in just-released reports from the Department of Justice, internal CIA investigations, and a new cache of recently declassified secret FBI, DEA, and INS files\u2014much of which was not known to Webb when writing the first edition of this book. Webb further explains the close working relationship that major drug traffickers had with U.S. Government agencies\u2014particularly the DEA\u2014and recounts the news of the past year regarding this breaking story. After more than two years of career-damning allegations leveled at Webb, joined in the past year by glowing reviews of the hardcover edition of Dark Alliance from shore to shore, the core findings of this courageous investigative reporter's work\u2014once fiercely denied\u2014are becoming matters of public record.

Gellhorn is incapable of writing a dull sentence. The Times (London) Martha Gellhorn was so fearless in a male way, and yet utterly capable of making men melt, writes New Yorker literary editor Bill Buford. As a journalist, Gellhorn covered every military conflict from the Spanish Civil War to Vietnam and Nicaragua. She also bewitched Eleanor Roosevelt's secret love and enraptured Ernest Hemingway with her courage as they dodged shell fire together. Hemingway is, of course, the unnamed other in the title of this tart memoir, first published in 1979, in which Gellhorn describes her globe-spanning adventures, both accompanied and alone. With razor-sharp humor and exceptional insight into place and character, she tells of a tense week spent among dissidents in Moscow; long days whiled away in a disused water tank with hippies clustered at Eilat on the Red Sea; and her journeys by sampan and horse to the interior of China during the Sino-Japanese War. Now including a foreward by Bill Buford and photographs of Gellhorn with Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Gary Cooper, and others, this new edition rediscovers the voice of an extraordinary woman and brings back into print an irresistibly entertaining classic.", "genre": ["Travel", "Nonfiction", "Memoir", "Biography", "History", "Autobiography", "Africa"], "author": "Martha Gellhorn", "rating": "3.82", "pages": "296"}, {"id": 456119, "title": "The Utah Gold Rush: The Lost Rhoades Mine and the Hathenbruck Legacy", "blurb": "With the release of this book, the search for the lost Rhoades Mine is narrowed to a few square miles of real estate due east of Kamas, Utah.

This gives promise that the greatest of all gold deposits (including remains of Montezuma's vast treasure (may soon be found. It all began in the mid-1800s when Ute chief Walkara bagged up sixty pounds of raw gold for Mormon bishop Isaac Morley. He took it to Brigham Young, who later assigned Thomas Rhoades (under a blood oath of secrecy) to fetch more of the sacred metal for minting coins and decorating temples. The gold came from the sacred Ute mines in the Uintah Mountains that were once worked by the Aztecs. In 1520 the Aztecs told Hernando Cortez that their vast hoards of gold came from seven mines far to the north (the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola)leading to Spanish exploration throughout the Uintah Mountains.

PerryMost of us experience the interactions of cryptography, communications, and computers as we go about our daily activities. While on our laptops, we conduct secure financial transactions and communicate about business and personal matters. But not long ago, only people with special security clearances working at secured communications centers had such access. This book looks at how this dramatic transition came about.J. V. Boone presents a historical overview of technological developments in cryptology and the closely associated fields of communications and computers. Having directed research at the National Security Agency (NSA) for years, he is well suited to tell the story. Boone identifies milestone accomplishments and activities in the three fields to provide an introduction to the talented people who have led developments and applications. He includes illustrations to give a feel for the equipment and systems, but his book's focus is on the essential ingredient for success in cryptology: brainpower. Everyone from high school students to policy developers in government and industry will be drawn to this concise history of the joint progress of cryptology, communications, and computers. Although he writes primarily from a military intelligence and command/control viewpoint, there are no involved explanations about how individual pieces of equipment function and no elaborate mathematical presentations.

The great canvas of the western landscape-in art, books, film-is today shared by the figures called Mountain Men. They were the trappers of the Rocky Mountain fur trade in the years following Lewis and Clark's Expedition of 1804-1806. With their bold journeys peaking, during the period of 1830-1840, they were the first white men to enter the vast wilderness reaches of the Rockies in search of beaver plews, as the skins were called. They feasted on the abundant buffalo, elk and other game, while living the ultimate free-spirited wilderness life. Often they paid the ultimate price for their ventures under the arrows, tomahawks, and knives of those native Americans whose lands they had entered. Tales of the Mountain Men, presents in one book many of the most engaging and revealing portraits of mountain men ever written. Ranging from nonfiction classics like Bernard DeVoto's Across the Wide Missouri through fiction from such acclaimed novels as A. B. Guthrie Jr.'s The Big Sky, this collection is destined to be well appreciated by the huge and dedicated audience fascinated by mountain man lore and legend. These readers include many who today participate in reenactments of the mountain man Rendezvous, with colorful costumes and competitions of traditional skills with authentic guns, knives, and tools. No book exists today with such a diverse and engaging collection of mountain man literature.

Time literally changed as the archipelago synchronized with the Western imperialists' reckoning of time. The solar calendar and clock became standard timekeeping devices, and society adapted to the abstractions inherent in modern notions of time. This set off a cascade of changes that completely reconfigured how humans interacted with each other and with their environment--a process whose analysis carries implications for other non-Western societies as well.By examining topics ranging from geology, ghosts, childhood, art history, and architecture to nature as a whole, Stefan Tanaka explores how changing conceptions of time destabilized inherited knowledge and practices and ultimately facilitated the reconfiguration of the archipelago's heterogeneous communities into the liberal-capitalist nation-state, Japan. However, this revolutionary transformation--where, in the words of Lewis Mumford, the clock, not the steam engine, is the key mechanism of the industrial age--has received little more than a footnote in the history of Japan.This book's innovative focus on time not only shifts attention away from debates about the failure (or success) of modernization toward how individuals interact with the overlay of abstract concepts upon their lives; it also illuminates the roles of history as discourse and as practice in this reconfiguration of society. In doing so, it will influence discussions about modernity well beyond the borders of Japan.\n...more", "genre": ["Cultural", "Japan"], "author": "Stefan Tanaka", "rating": "2.80", "pages": "240"}, {"id": 459018, "title": "Cognitive Therapy for Personality Disorders: A Schema-Focused Approach", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Psychology", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Jeffrey E.

On the occasion of his wife's breakdown, Freestone returns with her to her home town in the norther and takes a job in the local art school. Here we meet a whole gallery of startlingly realised teachers and students, presided over by David Storey's most comic creation to date, R. N. 'Skipper' Wilcox, a man who equates food with art, art with the past, and the past with his own idiosyncratic passions and vices. Then there are the Newmans who have arrived, ostensibly, to transform the town: Elizabeth, the wife, on the lookout for pleasure; Rebecca, the daughter, on the lookout for experience; and Neville Newman himself, a city planner, on the lookout, with his strange and menacing gang, for authority and power. Like some gigantic happening, unannounced, unrehearsed - convened perhaps, thought one is never sure, by Freestone himself - these characters, shadowed by the disturbing presence of Freestone's wife, trace out a compulsive and at times seemingly ungovernable pattern.

Rose, the elder, passed up college to marry her first love, Philip, and has spent the years raising her kids in the small town of Floralee, New Mexico. Lily, on the other hand, shot right out of college and into the high-powered world of medical sales and the heady thrill of having multiple lovers. But now, as Rose is 40 and Lily is 35, the two share the experience of watching their carefully arranged lives fall apart. Struck by the heartlessness of her job and of her boyfriend, Lily returns home to the family horse ranch for a bit of soul-searching--and finds her sister tackling her own inner demons. Rose, who's struggling to reestablish herself after the death of her husband, Philip, suddenly finds hope and comfort in a growing friendship with her boss, Austin. Although she falls in love with his inner qualities, Austin remains a depressed, alcoholic mess who pines after his ex-wife. As their relationship evolves, Rose fights to maintain her dignity and preserve her independent identity as Austin shuffles through attempts at sobriety and fidelity. Lily, meanwhile, reunites with her former high school flame Tres but fears this will become yet another meaningless affair. Understanding that if you gave up on love, all that was left was money and horses, (and fully appreciating the value of good horseflesh), these two throw themselves after love with equal parts inspiring courage and realistic fear. While the simplicity of Mapson's writing style most often complements the purity of this unadorned plot, the substance of the novel remains the interactions of the two sisters. Readers who enjoy the pleasantly puzzling issues of siblinghood will find the dynamics between these two fascinating. --Nancy R.E.

He develops the provocative thesis that human society has become an immense living being - a global superorganism in which we humans, knitted together by our modern technology and communication, are like the cells in an animal's body. Drawing on impressive research, Stock shows this newly formed superorganism to be more than metaphor; it is an actual living creature, which he has named Metaman, meaning beyond and transcending humans. This name acknowledges humanity's key role in the superorganism but also stresses that Metaman is more than humanity alone. Our increasing reliance on new technologies has joined us inextricably to our technology, while at the same time it has bound humanity together. The examples are all around us: our medical equipment and drugs, high-yield crop strains, superhighways, power and telecommunications networks. All these are part of Metaman. The implications of the new global culture and economy, the evolution of machine intelligence, and the advent of genetic engineering are vast. Through Metaman, life on earth is entering a new phase in its evolution, says Stock. Understanding Metaman tells us that the environmental problems of today are not carrying humanity toward destruction; that war between major powers is unlikely ever to occur again; that technology is not in conflict with the natural realm but is an extension of it; and that the very nature of human existence is being redefined, to our benefit. Metaman offers a profoundly hopeful vision of humanity's future. Stock doesn't ignore present-day problems but examines them from a completely new perspective, convincingly arguing that these are flee birth pains of Metaman.

Within the next few years, the global production of oil will peak. Thereafter, even with a switch to alternative energy sources, industrial societies will have less energy available to do all the things essential to their survival. We are entering a new era as different from the industrial era as the latter was from medieval times. The Party's Over deals head-on with this imminent decline of cheap oil. It shows how oil and war have always been closely related for the past century and how competition to control oil supplies is likely to lead to new resource wars in the Middle East, Central Asia and South America. Tracing the crucial role of fossil fuels in the rise of industrialism, the book discusses the degree to which energy alternatives can compensate for oil and recommends a managed transition to a slower-paced, low-energy, sustainable society in the future. This substantially revised edition brings the current debate over oil supplies and forecasts up to date, includes more recent evidence for a near-term oil peak, adds material on the looming natural gas crisis and on possible nonpetroleum sources of energy, and discusses in more depth the geopolitics of the steadily souring oil binge and the options now before us.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Politics", "Science", "Environment", "Peak Oil", "Environment", "Economics", "Environment", "Sustainability", "Biology", "Ecology", "History", "Sociology"], "author": "Richard Heinberg", "rating": "4.04", "pages": null}, {"id": 459715, "title": "Dynamic of Destruction: Culture and Mass Killing in the First World War", "blurb": "On 26 August 1914 the world-famous university library in the Belgian town of Louvain was looted and destroyed by German troops. The international community reacted in horror and the behavior of the Germans at Louvain came to be seen as the beginning of a different style of war, without the rules that had governed military conflict up to that point--a more total war, in which enemy civilians and their entire culture were now legitimate targets.  As award-winning historian Alan Kramer shows in this gripping and insightful volume, the destruction at Louvain was simply one symbolic moment in a vast wave of cultural destruction and mass killing that swept across the map of Europe at the time of the First World War. Using a wide range of examples and striking eye-witness accounts from England, France, Germany, and elsewhere, Kramer brings home the reality of the Great War, painting a picture of an entire continent plunging into a chilling new world of mass mobilization, total warfare, and the celebration of nationalist or ethnic violence--often directed expressly at the enemy's civilian population. Kramer examines the psychological impact of trench warfare, addresses the question of German atrocities (were the Germans particularly barbaric, or was savage behavior common on all sides?), and offers a disturbing summation of the war's impact on European culture. From the Western Front to the Balkans, from Italy to the war in the East, the First World War was the most apocalyptic the world had ever known.

They endure thousands of miles of lonely training in the Yukon trying to avoid thin ice, wolves, and rogue moose; they put up with the amused skepticism of Alaskan locals; and they pit themselves against the ultimate, fickle adversary--nature. RUNNING NORTH is the true story of how Ann Cook, her husband, George, and their young daughter, Kathleen, moved to Alaska and how their Siberians became the first team from the lower forty-eight states to finish the Yukon Quest. It tracks George on his horrific journey through the Yukon, recording the frostbite, the hallucinations that come with exhaustion, the wolves, and the nights out on the ice at minus ninety degrees Fahrenheit.

Challenging notions that the white backlash of the 1960s and 1970s was driven by increasing race resentment, Durr details the rise of a working-class populism shaped by mistrust of the means and ends of postwar liberalism in the face of urban decline. Exploring the effects of desegregation, deindustrialization, recession, and the rise of urban crime, Durr shows how legitimate economic, social, and political grievances convinced white working-class Baltimoreans that they were threatened more by the actions of liberal policymakers than by the incursions of urban blacks.While acknowledging the parochialism and racial exclusivity of white working-class life, Durr adopts an empathetic view of workers and their institutions.

Writing of mothers and their children, of childhood memories, of black leaders and black Africa, the poems in My House marked a new dimension in tone and philosophy for Nikki Giovanni when they first appeared at the beginning of her extraordinary career. Emotional and autobiographical, Nikki Giovanni personalizes the political--like no one else--and brings her house in all its complexity and glory to our own backyards. At once tough-minded and playful and with such famous classics as My House and Winter Poem, this reissue of Nikki Giovanni's 1972 collection will once again intoxicate those who have always loved her poems--and those who are just getting to know her work.As a witness to three generations, Nikki Giovanni has perceptively and poetically recorded her observations of both the outside world and the gentle yet enigmatic territory of the self. When her poems first emerged from the Black Rights Movement in the late 1960s, she immediately became a celebrated and controversial poet of the era. Written in one of the most commanding voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape at the end of the twentieth century, Nikki Giovanni's poems embody the fearless passion and spirited wit for which she is beloved and revered.Nikki Giovanni is one of the most influential black writers writing today. This, her second book of poetry, marked a new dimension in tone and philosophy-personal and autobiographical rather than political; it is also lively, loving, witty, and occasionally tough-minded. Divided into two sections, the poems center around her house-the rooms inside as well as outside. She writes of mothers and their children, of childhood memories, of black leaders and black Africa. This is an important book by a black woman written in and of the '70s.Nikki Giovanni has . . . become one of the most potent voices of our time. Her message is universal and the rhythm and language of her poetry can be compared favorably with that of the finest poets of the past. She is a beautiful and complete human being with a genius for describing the human condition.  Minneapolis TribuneTalent is light, but mature talent is a beacon and Nikki Giovanni has, by her own words, joined that small band of talented people who try to show us all the way to go home.

On February 13-15, 1945, 1,300 British and American aircrafts dropped 5,000 tons of incendiary and high-explosive bombs, destroying Dresden and causing a 3,000 F firestorm. Between 35,000 and 100,000 people died, among them American, British and Russian prisoners of war.Survivors' accounts capture the hope and courage that transcended the horror of the raid. In analyzing the rationale and planning behind the raid, McKee dissects the leadership egos, command rivalries, and hidden agendas that insidiously promoted terror bombing as a British policy later shared by her American ally.

He spent twelve years in research and many months in France doing archival work and then made several attempts until he felt he finally had the story he wanted to tell. He reached his conclusion about Joan's unique place in history only after studying in detail accounts written by both sides, the French and the English. Because of Mark Twain's antipathy to institutional religion, one might expect an anti-Catholic bias toward Joan or at least toward the bishops and theologians who condemned her. Instead one finds a remarkably accurate biography of the life and mission of Joan of Arc told by one of this country's greatest storytellers.

Architecture that entails surprise, even danger, is the subject of this exciting discourse on a body of work that has gained increasing international attention since the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Graz and Vienna came to represent the radical edge of European architecture. Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen looks at how this architecture tests the limits of the modern tradition, bringing to light work that is little known yet extremely consequential for contemporary theoretical discourse.Forged in a rarified architectural climate dominated by postwar Marxist-Freudian trends, the Austrian avant-garde challenges the traditional paradigms of objecthood, compositional form, programmic functionality, and spatial closure, emphasizing the fictional and the fantastic embodied in the more peripheral notions within the modern tradition: glass, ornament, machine mysticism, and the organic gestural line.Pelkonen moves between a solid analysis of individual works of architects and firms such as Volker Giencke, G\ufffdnter Domenig, Klaus Kada, Helmut Richter, COOP Himmelblau, and Haus-Rucker-Co, and others, and their historical and cultural contexts: philosophical debates on Heidegger, Bloch, Derrida, Merleau-Ponty, and Giorgio Agamben; and the postwar debate on the avant-garde through the works of Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter, Francis Bacon, and the Wiener Aktionisten.", "genre": ["Architecture"], "author": "Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen", "rating": "0.00", "pages": "203"}, {"id": 463905, "title": "Just Crazy!", "blurb": "Just Crazy!

On the run from his demanding father and the cruel butcher who employed him, Nick finds adventure beyond his wildest imaginings when he stows away on the ship of legendary Captain James Cook. Once he is discovered and put to work, Nick becomes party to some amazing sights. He meets indigenous natives of Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia, wonders at the sight of kangaroos, and shudders with horror when confronted with cannibalism. Nick survives a hurricane, a near shipwreck on the Great Barrier Reef, and a deadly bout with typhoid to become one of the few original crew members to successfully circumnavigate the globe with Cook and arrive safely back in England.

That any of us shall. Newbery Medal-winning Karen Hesse's story is based on actual Endeavour stowaway Nicholas Young, about whom little is known.

If pre-industrial societies were held together by common values, sentiments, and norms, equally shared by all, what holds modern societies, with their complex division of labor and non-cohesive social structure, together? What did this new social order mean for the autonomy of the individual? Durkheim argued that class conflict is not inherent in a capitalist society, as Marx contended, but that the unfettered growth of state power would lead to the extinction of individuality. Only in a free society that promotes voluntary bonds between its members, Durkheim suggested, can individuality prosper.In this new edition, the first since 1984, world-renowned Durkheim scholar Steven Lukes revisits and revises the original translation to enhance clarity, accuracy, and fluency for the contemporary reader. Lukes also highlights Durkheim\u2019s arguments by putting them into historical context with a timeline of important information.

The reading public in France seized upon it so avidly that its sale broke all records and passed 400,000 (in France alone) within five months. The jury that chooses France's leading literary award, the Prix Goncourt, performed the sensational act of advancing by several weeks the date of the award in order to be sure that no lesser prize went to this amazing book.Most extraordinary of all is the book itself, a drama of Jewish suffering, martyrdom and transfiguration which begins with a pogrom in the twelfth century, ends in a gas chamber and grips the reader throughout with its narrative strength, its human warmth, its simplicity, its humor and its understanding of people.

Yet the painting's creation is only the beginning of its fascinating story, which spans centuries of power play and intrigue, and has made it a witness to the rise and fall of the great powers of the Western world as it seduced its owners to ever greater heights of corruption and greed.Raphael's masterpiece was commissioned by Duke Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, the ruler of Urbino, in 1506. Raphael was only twenty-three years old, but he had already begun to acquire a reputation as a painter who was as ruthless in his pursuit of money as he was talented. The duke sent the painting to England's King Henry VII as a thank-you for naming him a knight in the Order of the Garter.The painting then mysteriously disappeared for one hundred years until King Charles I saw it hanging in the collection of the Earl of Pembroke and acquired it for a book of Holbein drawings. After Charles was beheaded in 1649, his collection was broken up and the painting made its way to the private gallery of the third-richest man in France, where it was ensconced in its own special room. Thirty years later, the philosopher Diderot was instructed by Catherine the Great of Russia to buy it for her vast collection at the Hermitage.The heroic curators of the Hermitage protected St. George and the Dragon from fire, water, and the anarchists of the Russian Revolution, until Joseph Stalin sold it in 1930 to raise cash. The secret buyer was Andrew Mellon, Treasury Secretary of the United States, who in doing so blatantly violated a U.S. sanction againstdoing any business with Soviet Russia. Mellon eventually founded The National Gallery in Washington, D.C., where St. George and the Dragon rests to this day.Exceptionally written and breathlessly paced, The Dragon's Trail is a microhistory that touches on the rise of the Tudors, the downfall of a Stuart, the twilight of the French aristocracy, the terrors of the Bolshevik revolution, and the depths of the Cold War -- all witnessed by one painting that inspired the best and the worst instincts in its owners.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Art", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Joanna Pitman", "rating": "3.58", "pages": "290"}, {"id": 467449, "title": "The Raphael Trail", "blurb": "St George and the Dragon is a supremely beautiful painting.

Wept. Matchless entertainment. So wrote Franz Kafka in one of his diaries, giving us but one hint of his little-known passion for the cinema. Until now, Kafka aficionados have been left to speculate about which films moved Kafka so powerfully and how those films might have influenced his writing. With Kafka Goes to the Movies, German actor and film director Hanns Zischler draws on years of detective work to provide the first account of Kafka's moviegoing life. Since many of Kafka's visits to the cinema occurred during bachelor trips with Max Brod, Zischler's research took him not only to Kafka's native Prague but to film archives in Munich, Milan, and Paris. Matching Kafka's cinematic references to reviews and stills from daily papers, Zischler hunted down rare films in collections all across Europe. A labor of love, then, by a true man of the cinema, Kafka Goes to the Movies brims with discoveries about the pioneering years of European film. With a wealth of illustrations, including reproductions of movie posters and other rare materials, Zischler opens a fascinating window onto movies that have been long forgotten or assumed lost.But the real highlights of the book are those about Kafka himself. Long considered one of the most enigmatic figures in literature, the Kafka that emerges in this work is strikingly human. Kafka Goes to the Movies offers an absorbing look at a witty, passionate, and indulgently curious writer, one who discovered and used the cinema as a place of enjoyment and escape, as a medium for the ambivalent encounter with modern life, and as a filter for the changing world around him.", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Film"], "author": "Hanns Zischler", "rating": "3.19", "pages": "143"}, {"id": 467644, "title": "One Life", "blurb": "Raising fundamental questions about women's choices and the very nature of femininity and maternal ambition, 'One Life' is a poignant and emotional exploration of womanhood that asks the question of what happens when the most natural thing in the world - the act of conception - stays just out of reach.\nRaising fundamental questions about women's choices and the very nature of femininity and maternal ambition, 'One Life' is a poignant and emotional exploration of womanhood that asks the question of what happens when the most natural thing in the world - the act of conception - stays just out of reach.\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction"], "author": "Rebecca Frayn", "rating": "2.90", "pages": null}, {"id": 467702, "title": "God's Little Devotional Book for Leaders (God's Little Devotional Book)", "blurb": "The ability to influence, motivate, and inspire is highly sought after, but where does a leader go when he or she needs direction?

It's a small irony, then, that his career falls so neatly into national phases: Russian, German, French, and American, plus the protracted coda he spend in a Swiss luxury hotel during his final decade. The Gift, which he wrote between 1935 and 1937 in Berlin, is the grand summation of his second phase. It describes, for starters, the sentimental education of a young Russian writer, Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev. This hyphenated creation has more than a few things in common with the author, despite Nabokov's vehement denial in the novel's foreword. Still, only a nitwit would read The Gift for its autobiographical revelations. What this early masterpiece does offer is a wealth of lyrical, witty, heartbreaking prose, beautifully translated from the Russian by Michael Scammell (with an assist from Nabokov himself). Who else would note the way a street rises at a barely perceptible angle, beginning with a post office and ending with a church, like an epistolary novel? Who else has ever administered the satirical shiv to his characters with such deadly, almost affectionate aplomb? Shirin himself was a thickset man with a reddish crew cut, always badly shaved and wearing large spectacles behind which, as in two aquariums, swam two tiny, transparent eyes--which were completely impervious to visual impressions. He was blind like Milton, deaf like Beethoven, and a blockhead to boot. Of course, only a fraction of The Gift is taken up with this sort of demolition derby. Fyodor's romance with Zina, for example, occasions the most ardent prose of Nabokov's career: And not only was Zina cleverly and elegantly made to measure for him by a very painstaking fate, but both of them, forming a single shadow, were made to the measure of something not quite comprehensible, but wonderful and benevolent and continuously surrounding them. (Shades of Volodya and V\u00e9ra? Only the deceased husband and wife, and perhaps Stacy Schiff, know for sure.) At the same time, The Gift is a brilliant, mesmerizing riff on the history of Russian literature, with elaborate bouquets tossed to Pushkin and Gogol. There's also a hilarious yet somehow tender evisceration of the do-gooding polemicist Nikolai Chernyshevski--which was suppressed, in fact, when the novel was originally serialized by a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 magazine. As should be clear by now, The Gift defies any attempt at quick-and-dirty summary. But the book plays the most pleasurable kind of havoc with our stuffy notions of narrative structure and linguistic protocol. And as Nabokov repeatedly wraps the reader's consciousness around his little finger, he never holds back on that ultimate literary gift: pleasure. --James Marcus", "genre": ["Fiction", "Russia", "Classics", "Russian Literature", "Literature", "Novels", "20th Century"], "author": "Vladimir Nabokov", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "346"}, {"id": 472101, "title": "The Wishing Game", "blurb": "In the bleak winter term of 1954 something terrible happens at Kirkston Abbey School for Boys.

Kester Larne is the heir to Ardeith, a sprawling Louisiana plantation whose glory days are long behind it, and he sweeps Eleanor off her feet. Only after they marry does she learn that Ardeith is mortgaged to the hilt and she will need every ounce of her ingenuity to save it . . . and her marriage.\n...more", "genre": ["Historical", "Historical Fiction", "Historical", "Fiction", "Romance", "Romance", "Historical Romance", "Classics", "Literature", "American", "Novels", "War", "World War I"], "author": "Gwen Bristow", "rating": "4.04", "pages": "280"}, {"id": 473690, "title": "Journeys to the Twilight Zone", "blurb": "Under the skillful editorship of Rod Serling's widow, this anthology offers a wonderful array of new ventures into the unexplored territory of the imagination.

A 14th-century author described their profound mystical experience as entering the cloud of unknowing. Yet during the 500 years after this great monastic flowering, this precious tradition--and the direct path to union with God it described--was virtually lost.For decades, Father Thomas Keating, together with other monks, examined this great question: Could anyone enter the cloud of unknowing through a prayer practice specifically created to attain it? Keating reached back in time for clues about the prayer forms of the Christian mystics. He synthesized his work into a Centering Prayer method that has helped thousands of seekers travel the contemplative path to divine union.From infancy, Father Keating teaches, we accumulate emotional layers, or programs, as a result of traumatic experiences. The practice of Centering Prayer engages directly with the unconscious and loosens old traumas that hinder your spiritual development. This form of divine therapy draws from a contemplative method that has brought profound inner transformation into the lives of thousands of practitioners. The Contemplative Journey is Father Thomas Keating's great masterwork: a complete curriculum devoted to a Christian path for achieving the still point of resting in God.Learn More About: The four elements essential to your spiritual healthThree on-the-spot questions to diagnose core troublesHow to overcome deeply ingrained habits with prayerMastering the three essential human relationshipsThe true purpose of marriageHow to use Centering Prayer as a spiritual antibiotic", "genre": ["Spirituality", "Christian"], "author": "Thomas Keating", "rating": "4.59", "pages": "Audio"}, {"id": 473768, "title": "Brassa\u00ef L'universel", "blurb": "Brassa is a living eye, wrote Henry Miller of the Hungarian-born artist who adopted Paris after World War I and became one of its most celebrated photographers.

So through this bold gesture by Elder Talmage and the First Presidency, the cloak of mystery was removed and the temple revealed to the public for what it was\u2014a sanctuary similar to a monastery\u2014or perhaps an ashram or kiva, depending on one\u2019s tradition\u2014where adherents focus undivided attention on attaining spiritual insight.

But music could not be explained without addressing language, and could not be accounted for without understanding the evolution of the human body and mind. Thus Mithen arrived at the wildly ambitious project that unfolds in this book: an exploration of music as a fundamental aspect of the human condition, encoded into the human genome during the evolutionary history of our species.Music is the language of emotion, common wisdom tells us. In The Singing Neanderthals, Mithen introduces us to the science that might support such popular notions. With equal parts scientific rigor and charm, he marshals current evidence about social organization, tool and weapon technologies, hunting and scavenging strategies, habits and brain capacity of all our hominid ancestors, from australopithecines to Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis and Neanderthals to Homo sapiens--and comes up with a scenario for a shared musical and linguistic heritage. Along the way he weaves a tapestry of cognitive and expressive worlds--alive with vocalized sound, communal mimicry, sexual display, and rhythmic movement--of various species.The result is a fascinating work--and a succinct riposte to those, like Steven Pinker, who have dismissed music as a functionless evolutionary byproduct.\n...more", "genre": ["Music", "Science", "Nonfiction", "Anthropology", "History", "Humanities", "Language", "Humanities", "Linguistics", "Biology", "Evolution", "History", "Archaeology", "Psychology"], "author": "Steven Mithen", "rating": "3.89", "pages": "384"}, {"id": 474497, "title": "Minima Moralia.

The Little LISPer teaches you how to think in the LISP language. . . an inexpensive, enjoyable introduction. -- Gregg Williams, ByteThe notion that thinking about computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do sets both The Little Schemer (formerly known as The Little LISPer ) and its new companion volume, The Seasoned Schemer, apart from other books on LISP. The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is compelling as they present abstract concepts in a humorous and easy-to-grasp fashion. Together, these books will open new doors of thought to anyone who wants to find out what computing is really about.The Little Schemer introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra -- things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas. The Seasoned Schemer informs the reader about additional dimensions of computing: functions as values, change of state, and exceptional cases.The Little LISPer has been a popular introduction to LISP for many years. It had appeared in French and Japanese. The Little Schemer andThe Seasoned Schemer are worthy successors and will prove equally popular as textbooks for Scheme courses as well as companion texts for any complete introductory course in Computer Science.Download DrScheme - a graphical environment for developing Scheme programs\n...more", "genre": ["Computer Science", "Programming", "Science", "Computer Science", "Nonfiction", "Computer Science", "Computers", "Computer Science", "Software", "Science", "Technology", "Computer Science", "Technical", "Science", "Engineering", "Reference", "Science"], "author": "Daniel P.

As a result, attention to the practices of adoption sheds light upon deeply held, but often tacit assumptions about what is natural and what is social in human life. from the IntroductionThe institution of adoption has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years as the adoption world has undergone seismic shifts: the rise in international and transracial adoptions and the effects of global economics; adoption by gays and lesbians; increasing openness in the adoption process; and changes in domestic welfare policy on adoption. Adoption Matters adds to our understanding of reproduction, parenting, and familial bonds, personal identity and selfknowledge, and contemporary social policy. The contributors to Adoption Matters explore a range of related topics, such as the manner in which interracial or international adoption affects the way we perceive the relationships among race, ethnicity, and culture and how class affects one s life prospects and choices.\n...more", "genre": ["Parenting", "Adoption", "Philosophy"], "author": "Sally Haslanger", "rating": "4.17", "pages": "336"}, {"id": 476527, "title": "Their Doorstep Baby", "blurb": "Husband and wife Claire and Adam Townsend have been longing to have a child together, but with no success.

Given that all of the clubs where she worked prohibited physical contact between the exotic dancers and their customers, in G-Strings and Sympathy Frank asks what\u2014if not sex or even touching\u2014the repeat customers were purchasing from the clubs and from the dancers. She finds that the clubs provide an intermediate space\u2014not work, not home\u2014where men can enjoyably experience their bodies and selves through conversation, fantasy, and ritualized voyeurism. At the same time, she shows how the dynamics of male pleasure and privilege in strip clubs are intertwined with ideas about what it means to be a man in contemporary America.Frank\u2019s ethnography draws on her work as an exotic dancer in five clubs, as well as on her interviews with over thirty regular customers\u2014middle-class men in their late-twenties to mid-fifties. Reflecting on the customers\u2019 dual desires for intimacy and visibility, she explores their paradoxical longings for authentic interactions with the dancers, the ways these aspirations are expressed within the highly controlled and regulated strip clubs, and how they relate to beliefs and fantasies about social class and gender. She considers how regular visits to strip clubs are not necessarily antithetical to marriage or long-term heterosexual relationships, but are based on particular beliefs about marriage and monogamy that make these clubs desirable venues. Looking at the relative classiness of the clubs where she worked\u2014ranging from the city\u2019s most prestigious clubs to some of its dive bars\u2014she reveals how the clubs are differentiated by reputations, dress codes, cover charges, locations, and clientele, and describes how these distinctions become meaningful and erotic for the customers. Interspersed throughout the book are three fictional interludes that provide an intimate look at Frank\u2019s experiences as a stripper\u2014from the outfits to the gestures, conversations, management, coworkers, and, of course, the customers.Focusing on the experiences of the male clients, rather than those of the female sex workers, G-Strings and Sympathy provides a nuanced, lively, and tantalizing account of the stigmatized world of strip clubs.\n...more", "genre": ["Anthropology", "Nonfiction", "Sexuality", "Sex Work", "Sexuality", "Feminism", "Sociology", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Anthropology", "Ethnography"], "author": "Katherine  Frank", "rating": "3.71", "pages": "368"}, {"id": 476946, "title": "Sam's Letters to Jennifer", "blurb": "Grief-stricken by a recent tragedy, Jennifer returns to the resort village where she grew up to help her beloved grandmother.

Based on Steiner's Norton Lectures on the art and lore of teaching, Lessons of the Masters evokes a host of exemplary figures, including Socrates and Plato, Jesus and his disciples, Virgil and Dante, Heloise and Abelard, Tycho Brahe and Johann Kepler, the Baal Shem Tov, Confucian and Buddhist sages, Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, Nadia Boulanger, and Knute Rockne.Pivotal in the unfolding of Western culture are Socrates and Jesus, charismatic masters who left no written teachings, founded no schools. In the efforts of their disciples, in the passion narratives inspired by their deaths, Steiner sees the beginnings of the inward vocabulary, the encoded recognitions of much of our moral, philosophical, and theological idiom. He goes on to consider a diverse array of traditions and disciplines, recurring throughout to three underlying themes: the master's power to exploit his student's dependence and vulnerability; the complementary threat of subversion and betrayal of the mentor by his pupil; and the reciprocal exchange of trust and love, of learning and instruction between master and disciple.Forcefully written, passionately argued, Lessons of the Masters is itself a masterly testament to the high vocation and perilous risks undertaken by true teacher and learner alike.", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Education", "Nonfiction", "Essays", "Literature", "Teaching", "Criticism"], "author": "George Steiner", "rating": "3.90", "pages": "198"}, {"id": 478030, "title": "Romancing the Home: How to Have a Marriage That Sizzles", "blurb": "How to have a marriage that sizzles.

His system collapsed when Bertrand Russell discovered a contradiction in it. Thereafter, mathematicians and logicians, beginning with Russell himself, turned in other directions to look for a framework for modern abstract mathematics. Over the past couple of decades, however, logicians and philosophers have discovered that much more is salvageable from the rubble of Frege's system than had previously been assumed. A variety of repaired systems have been proposed, each a consistent theory permitting the development of a significant portion of mathematics.This book surveys the assortment of methods put forth for fixing Frege's system, in an attempt to determine just how much of mathematics can be reconstructed in each. John Burgess considers every proposed fix, each with its distinctive philosophical advantages and drawbacks. These systems range from those barely able to reconstruct the rudiments of arithmetic to those that go well beyond the generally accepted axioms of set theory into the speculative realm of large cardinals. For the most part, Burgess finds that attempts to fix Frege do less than advertised to revive his system. This book will be the benchmark against which future analyses of the revival of Frege will be measured.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy"], "author": "John P.

Situated on opposite sides of the Atlantic, in different churches, and on different sides of the just war/pacifist fence, we exchanged long emails that rehearsed on a small scale the great national and international debates that were taking place around us. We discovered the common ground we shared, as well as some predictable and some surprising points of difference....When the initial hostilities ended, our conversation continued, and we felt the urgency of contributing to a wider Christian debate about whether and when war could be justified. -- From the PrefaceSo began a dynamic collaboration that developed into a civil but provocative debate over matters of war and peace that is Faith and Force. From the ancient battles between Greek city-states to the Crusades to the World Wars of the twentieth-century to the present-day wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the Middle East, aggressors and defenders alike have claimed the mantle of righteousness and termed their actions just. But can the carnage of war ever be morally grounded? And if so, how?These are the questions that David L. Clough, a Methodist proponent of pacifism, and Brian Stiltner, a Catholic theologian and just war adherent, have vowed to answer -- together. With one voice, Clough and Stiltner outline and clarify issues of humanitarian intervention, weapons proliferation, and preventative war against rogue states. Their writing is grounded in Christian tradition and provides a fresh and illuminating account of the complexities and nuances of the pacifist and just war positions.In each chapter Clough and Stiltner engage in debate on the issues, demonstrating a respectful exchange of ideas absent in much contemporary political discourse -- whether on television or in the classroom. The result is a well-reasoned, challenging repartee that searches for common ground within the Christian tradition and on behalf of the faithful promotion of justice -- yet one that also recognizes genuine differences that cannot be bridged easily. Intended for a broad audience, Faith and Force is the perfect foil to the shrill screeching that surrounds partisan perspectives on military power and its use.To help with using the book in a classroom context, the authors have provided Questions for Reflection and Discussion for each chapter.

As conflicts continue to proliferate around the globe, the perception of a colossal, unyielding, and unavoidable struggle between Islam and the West has intensified. These numerous conflicts, both actual and ideological, have revived fears of an ongoing clash of civilizations--an intractable and irreconcilable conflict of values between Western cultures and an Islam that is portrayed as hostile and alien.The New Crusades takes head-on the idea of an emergent Cold War between Islam and the West.

Phrases like phone home and the music score from Jaws are now part of our cultural script, appearing in commercials, comedy routines, and common conversation.Yet few scholars have devoted time to studying Spielberg's vast output of popular films despite the director's financial and aesthetic achievements.

The blockbuster creator of E.T., Jaws, and Schindler's List talks about dreams and the almighty dollar.I'm not really interested in making money, he says. That's always come as the result of success, but it's not been my goal, and I've had a tough time proving that to people.Ranging from Spielberg's twenties to his mid-fifties, the interviews chart his evolution from a brash young filmmaker trying to make his way in Hollywood, to his spectacular blockbuster triumphs, to his maturation as a director seeking to inspire the imagination with meaningful subjects.The Steven Spielberg who emerges in these talks is a complex mix of businessman and artist, of arrogance and insecurity, of shallowness and substance. Often interviewers will uncover the director's human side, noting how changes in Spielberg's personal life -- marriage, divorce, fatherhood, remarriage -- affect his movies.

An elegant summation of one of the most remarkable careers in anthropology, it is at the same time an eloquent statement of the purposes and possibilities of anthropology's interpretive powers.

Louis MacNeice, Valediction  These words express a truth of conservatism that has discomfited conservatives in the years covered by this volume. This collection of columns shows how, in the mid-1990s, conservatives fancied themselves poised to conduct a revolution, a radical reorientation of politics and governance. But in the late 1990s, they have discovered how resistant a complex nation is to being undone and rewoven.  In this volume, George F. Will, distinguished political columnist and cultural critic, examines many episodes of the conservative tribulations and the liberal accommodations to the new political landscape. These writings present a map of the landscape, a guide for people perplexed by the gap between contemporary political theories and practices.  With his customary linguistic flair and acerbic wit, Mr. Will tackles a wide range of subjects, including political correctness on college campuses; extreme fighting; the 1996 presidential campaign; judicial activism; ESPN; and Corvettes.

John was the thoughtful, intelligent one, celebrated for his sharp wit and swift put-downs. Privately, he was a complex man: a superstar who hated the restrictions of being famous; a singer who disliked the sound of his own voice; a devoted husband who was publicly unfaithful. His song-writing partnership with Paul McCartney changed the parameters of popular music, and his early prose writing added to the richness and diversity of the English language.After The Beatles broke up, John's relationship with Yoko Ono became one of the great love stories of our times, and with her he developed into both an interesting conceptual artist and an influential campaigner for peace. After an intense period of experimentation, his music also developed and matured. Despite his talent and commitment to the world of the arts, when his son Sean was born he took five years out of the public eye dedicating himself to raising his child.John Lennon: Unseen Archives comprehensively chronicles the life of the world's most famous pop-star peace campaigner. The majority of the photographs are from the archive of the Daily Mail and they are accompanied by a detailed commentary which provides an insight into how John Lennon became more than a musician and went on to influence an entire generation. This wonderful book captures the impact he made upon the world; the memories of which still linger with us today.Marie Clayton grew up during the Beatles years and was at art college when the Four were still Fab.

To recover the transformative power of the gospel\u2014the good news\u2014Gomes says we must go beyond the Bible and rediscover how to live out Jesus' original revolutionary message of hope:Dietrich Bonhoeffer once warned against cheap grace, and I warn now against cheap hope. Hope is not merely the optimistic view that somehow everything will turn out all right in the end if everyone just does as we do. Hope is the more rugged, the more muscular view that even if things don't turn out all right and aren't all right, we endure through and beyond the times that disappoint or threaten to destroy us.This gospel is offensive and always overturns the status quo, Gomes tells us. It's not good news for those who wish not to be disturbed, and today our churches resound with shrill speeches of fear and exclusivity or tepid retellings of a health-and-wealth gospel. With his unique blend of eloquence and insight, Gomes invites us to hear anew the radical nature of Jesus' message of hope and change.

Now, renowned British journalist and historian Godfrey Hodgson takes aim at this popular view in a book that promises to become one of the most important political histories of our time. More Equal Than Others looks back on twenty-five years of what Hodgson calls the conservative ascendancy in America, demonstrating how it has come to dominate American politics.Hodgson disputes the notion that the rise of conservatism has spread affluence and equality to the American people. Quite the contrary, he writes, the most distinctive feature of American society in the closing years of the twentieth century was its great and growing inequality. He argues that the combination of conservative ideology and corporate power and dominance by mass media obsessed with lifestyle and celebrity have caused America to abandon much of what was best in its past. In fact, he writes, income and wealth inequality have become so extreme that America now resembles the class-stratified societies of early twentieth-century Europe. More Equal Than Others addresses a broad range of issues, with chapters on politics, the new economy, immigration, technology, women, race, and foreign policy, among others.

This book, the first history of an orphanage ever published, tells the story of the HOA's development from a nineteenth-century institution into a model twentieth-century child-care facility. Because of the humane and benevolent attitude of the New York Jewish community toward its orphans, the harsh authoritarianism and Dickensian conditions typical of contemporary orphanages were gradually replaced there by a nurturing approach that looked after the religious, social, and personal needs of the children. Though primarily an instrument of social control, the HOA was also an expression of Jewish ethnicity. Its history is set in a larger context that includes the life and character of the New York Jewish community, the city's immigrant population, the social and economic conditions of the time, the child-saving efforts of other groups, and the debate over institutional versus foster care. Drawing from HOA archives, published sources, and his personal experience as a resident from 1932 to 1941, Hyman Bogen brings a unique perspective to child-saving efforts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His compelling tale portrays daily life for those who lived and worked in such institutions. He illustrates how an enlightened orphanage, rather than crushing the spirit of its young residents, can help children to gain self-esteem and become secure adults. Bogen's tale will be of particular interest to urban and social historians, to city and government officials, and to social workers, as well as to anyone concerned with the growing crisis in child-care options.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction"], "author": "Hyman Bogen", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "304"}, {"id": 481124, "title": "The City: A Vision in Woodcuts", "blurb": "An absolute song for an ongoing visit with timelessness. \u2014 The New York TimesThis graphic novel by an Expressionist master offers a stunning depiction of urban Europe between the world wars.

First published in Germany in 1925, it presents unforgettable images from the tense and dynamic Weimar period, rendered in 100 woodcuts of remarkable force and beauty.A pacifist during World War I, Belgian-born Frans Masereel (1889-1972) sympathized with the struggles of the working classes and strived to make his art accessible to ordinary people. His evocative woodcuts convey scenes of work and leisure, wealth and deprivation, and joy and loneliness. Banned by the Nazis, Masereel's works were championed in Communist countries; however, the artist steered clear of political affiliations. His clarity of vision transcends any propagandist use of the images, which stand as timeless indictments of oppression and injustice.Thomas Mann described Masereel's works as so strangely compelling, so deeply felt, so rich in ideas that one never tires of looking at them.

Of V.I.'s creator, the Chicago Tribune says Sara Paretsky has no peer. Now Paretsky brings her incomparable storytelling brilliance to her most powerful Warshawski novel yet. Total Recall follows the Chicago P.I. on a road that winds back more than fifty years -- and into an intricate maze of wartime lies, heartbreaking secrets, and harrowing retribution. For V.I., the journey begins with a national conference in downtown Chicago, where angry protesters are calling for the recovery of Holocaust assets. Replayed on the evening news is the scene of a slight man who has stood up at the conference to tell an astonishing story of a childhood shattered by the Holocaust -- a story that has devastating consequences for V.I.'s cherished friend and mentor, Lotty Herschel. Lotty was a girl of nine when she emigrated from Austria to England, one of a group of children wrenched from their parents and saved from the Nazi terror just before the war broke out. Now stunningly -- impossibly -- it appears that someone from that long-lost past may have returned. With the help of a recovered-memory therapist, Paul Radbuka has recently learned his true identity. But is he who he claims to be? Or is he a cunning impostor who has usurped someone else's history ... a history Lotty has tried to forget for over fifty years? As a frightened V.I. watches her friend unravel, she sets out to help in the only way she can: by investigating Radbuka's past. Already working on a difficultcase for a poor family cheated of their life insurance, she tries to balance Lotty's needs with her client's, only to find that both are spiraling into a whirlpool of international crime that stretches from Switzerland and Germany to Chicago's South Side. As the atrocities of the past reach out to engulf the living, V.I. struggles to decide whose memories of a terrible war she can trust, and moves closer to a chilling realization of the truth -- a truth that almost destroys her oldest friend. With fierce emotional power, Sara Paretsky has woven a gripping and morally complex novel of crime and punishment, memory and illusion. Destined to become a suspense classic, Total Recall proves once again the daring and compelling genius of Sara Paretsky.\n...more", "genre": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Crime", "Mystery", "Detective", "Thriller", "Mystery Thriller", "Thriller", "World War II", "Holocaust", "Mystery", "Noir", "Audiobook", "Anthologies", "Collections"], "author": "Sara Paretsky", "rating": "3.96", "pages": "414"}, {"id": 482060, "title": "Sherlock Holmes", "blurb": "Sherlock Holmes encarna valores universais e atemporais. \u00c9 tranquilizador, em uma sociedade marcada por mudan\u00e7as profundas, ter um super-her\u00f3i que resolve nossos problemas de maneira eficaz e sem emo\u00e7\u00f5es aparentes.Este volume cont\u00e9m os livros: Os \u00daltimos Casos de Sherlock Holmes (contos) - 1917; Hist\u00f3rias de Sherlock Holmes (contos) - 1927.Cole\u00e7\u00e3o em 4 volumes da obra completa de Sherlock Holmes.", "genre": ["Classics", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Crime", "Short Stories", "Detective", "Mystery Thriller"], "author": "Arthur Conan Doyle", "rating": "4.41", "pages": "Trade"}, {"id": 482098, "title": "Jerry Lee Lewis Rocks", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Biography", "Music"], "author": "Robert Palmer", "rating": "3.46", "pages": "128"}, {"id": 482105, "title": "Transformation: Understanding the Three Levels of Masculine Consciousness", "blurb": "Presenting an original and vital model for psychological development, the brilliant and pioneering author of He, She, and We offers a new understanding of the stages of personal growth through which maturity and wholeness can be achieved.

The island's survival is threatened by the Long Winter, and not even the High Priest's ancient ceremony of renewal can put an end to the suffering from the hunger and the cold.Katook, a small but courageous young lemur, lives in the village of Kattakuk.

Forced to journey across the vast sea in search of a new home, Katook encounters great perils and marvels on his quest and undergoes profound tests of trust and friendship.

British novelist ELIZABETH CLEGHORN GASKELL (1810-1865)-whose books were sometimes initially credited to, simply, Mrs. Gaskell-is now recognized as having created some of the most complex and broadminded depictions of women in the literature of the age, and is today justly celebrated for her precocious use of the regional dialect and slang of England's industrial North.North and South-Gaskell's fourth novel, which was originally serialized in 1854 and 1855 in the periodical Household Words, edited by Gaskell's friend Charles Dickens-draws on Gaskell's own life as the wife of a progressive preacher in Manchester for its tale of the tumultuous romance between a minister's daughter and a wealthy mill owner. The plight of the poor as well as the class divisions of the era come to the fore here, and helped establish the author's reputation as a champion of the working class. Adapted as an acclaimed 2004 BBC miniseries, this is perhaps Gaskell's most beloved work.Friend and literary companion to such figures as Charlotte Bront\u00eb-of whom Gaskell wrote an applauded 1857 biography-Gaskell is today being restored to her rightful place alongside her.

The book will be a joy to ramble through for all lovers of Arnheim's work, and indeed for anyone who shares Arnheim's contagious interest in the order that lies behind art, nature, and human life. It is a seedbed of ideas and observations in his special fields of psychology and the arts. I have avoided mere images and I have avoided mere thoughts, says Arnheim in the Introduction, but whenever an episode observed or a striking sentence read yielded a piece of insight I had not met before, I wrote it down and preserved it. There are also glimpses of his personal life\u0097his wife, his cats, his students, his neighbors and colleagues.

It is a peculiar statement, because Sinatra is precisely asymmetrical. How to reconcile the enchanting crooner and the explosive bully? What to make of the smooth tones of his voice and the rough edges of his persona? To find the true correspondence between the public and the private Sinatra, the artist and the man, is no easy task. John Lahr, drama critic for The New Yorker and one of the finest writers on the performing arts working today, has done just this in Sinatra: The Artist and the ManLahr traces the trajectory of the solitary latchkey kid from Hoboken, New Jersey, into the stratosphere of fame. Sinatra kept company with presidents and mobsters; he kept up the front of a happy family life for as long as he could and then took up with the most desired women in the world--Ava Gardner, Lauren Bacall, Anita Ekberg, Marilyn Monroe, and many, many more. He led a life of manic gregariousness, yet spoke to the romance and loneliness of the wee small hours of the morning. He desperately needed to exist within the gaze of the audience but at the same time would express aloofness toward his fans, saying he was happiest when I'm onstage all by myself with an orchestra and nobody to bug me. Sinatra: The Artist and the Man also examines the miracle of Sinatra's return--much of what is marvelous about Sinatra today is that we know who he is at all, so far did he fall in the late forties. Sinatra came back with a vengeance as Angelo Maggio in From Here to Eternity, a heartfelt and brilliantly comic performance that won him an Academy Award. At the same time, he reclaimed control of the recording studio and, with the help of an ingenious arranger named Nelson Riddle, perfected the swinging sound of his mature years. Sinatra then proceeded to build a media empire that has been the standard by which all other stars have measured their success. The artist and the man: Sinatra epitomized control and he raged uncontrollably, destroying friendships, love affairs, and a plate-glass window or two; he won fans around the world across three generations, created an unparalleled body of recorded work, and almost single-handedly invented the postwar American swagger and the image, Lahr writes, of perfect individualism.Sinatra's life and art happen to be extremely well documented in photographs--from Weegee's hilarious pictures of bobby-soxer hysteria at New York's Paramount Theatre to William Read Woodfield's definitive and rare Chairman of the Board images. Sinatra: The Artist and the Man collects one hundred of the best photographs ever taken of Sinatra (some never before published)--representing his film work, the special intensity of his recording sessions, and the many swinging nights of this complex and fascinating man.", "genre": ["Music", "Nonfiction", "Biography"], "author": "John Lahr", "rating": "3.85", "pages": "128"}, {"id": 482784, "title": "No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities", "blurb": "Ellen Schrecker's award-winning and highly-acclaimed No Ivory Tower recounts the previously untold story of how the anti-Communist furor during the 1950's affected the nation's colleges and universities.

She describes how the hundreds of professors called before the investigating committees of the McCarthy era confronted the same dilemma most other witnesses had to face, deciding whether to cooperate with the committees and name names or to refuse such cooperation and risk losing their jobs.Drawing on previously untouched archives and dozens of personal interviews, Schrecker re-creates the climate of fear that pervaded American campuses, as the nation's educational leaders responded to the national obsession with Communism as well as their own fears about the damage that notoriety might do to the reputations of their institutions. As a result, firings occurred everywhere--at Ivy League universities, large state schools and small private colleges--and the presence of an unofficial but effective blacklist meant that most of these unfrocked professors could not find regular college teaching jobs in the U.S. until well after the McCarthyist furor had begun to subside in the 1960s.No Ivory Tower helps to explain how the McCarthyism, which many people even then saw as a betrayal of this nation's most cherished ideals, gained so much power.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "North American Hi...", "American History", "Education", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Ellen Schrecker", "rating": "3.72", "pages": "448"}, {"id": 482810, "title": "Fundamentals of Financial Accounting- W/CD", "blurb": "", "genre": ["Textbooks", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Fred Phillips", "rating": "3.14", "pages": "Paperback"}, {"id": 482837, "title": "Brown Sugar: Eighty Years of America's Black Female Superstars", "blurb": "And we can't forget the others: Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Katherine Dunham, Hazel Scott, Marian Anderson, Dinah Washington, Pearl Bailey, Dorothy Dandridge, Leontyne Price, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, Tina Tuner...

A third-generation white witch, Titania Hardie shares a vast knowledge that has been passed down to her by relatives in the recently published Bewitched, which Spirit Magazine includes in its list of 50 of the Best New Titles of the year. In this book she brings forward her training in parapsychology, exploring the connections between nature and well-being and the healing effects of color.In her first book, the highly acclaimed Hocus Pocus, and in Bewitched, Hardie focuses on the heart, offering a collection of spells that conjure up both love and romance, spells of the heart, mind, and wish power. Her incredibly vast knowledge of herbalism punctuates the six spell-filled chapters.The first chapter is dedicated to those who are looking for love, to anyone who feels that the night sky of love is without one special star. The second chapter, Two's Company, focuses on the spells that help move flirtations into the realm of reality; the Moonlight Basil spell, for example, works on a love affair that has already begun but needs a little help because it appears that the relationship is going nowhere. In the third chapter, Three's a Crowd, Hardie helps resolve difficulties a third party may cause a couple. Her spell Bite the Dust can be used if your loved one shows every sign of being happy with you but is having a difficult time letting go of a past relationship.

In this series of six spirited, informal lectures, Knuth explores the relationships between his vocation and his faith, revealing the unique perspective that his work with computing has lent to his understanding of God.His starting point is the 3:16 project, an application of mathematical random sampling to the books of the Bible. The first lectures tell the story of the project's conception and execution, exploring its many dimensions of language translation, aesthetics, and theological history. Along the way, Knuth explains the many insights he gained from such interdisciplinary work.

At the heart of this fast-paced thriller is the seven-year-old daughter of the president of the United States, who has witnessed something so awful it's left her in a catatonic state. Now, the woman who hopes to save her must trust her heart and her life to a mysterious man with a nefarious reputation. When masked intruders break into a presidential stronghold and try to kidnap the president's daughter, Cassie, the child witnesses several brutal murders. She survives, thanks to the efforts of Michael Travis, a man who skirts the law and makes a living in the international underworld, but the shock leaves her dwelling in a state somewhere between consciousness and death. The president puts his daughter in the hands of Dr. Jessica Riley, who helped her younger sister, Melissa, recover from a similar condition a few years earlier. Though fully recovered, Melissa's bout with catatonia left her with a curious side effect: the ability to merge her mind with the consciousness of others who are catatonic. As Cassie's condition worsens, her only hope lies with two people: Melissa, who can get into Cassie's mind, and Travis, whose presence has a calming affect on the child's life-threatening seizures. But there's a problem: Travis has a host of deadly assassins breathing down his neck and isn't inclined to stay, yet his conscience won't let him desert the child, either. So he takes Cassie, Jessica, and Melissa with him, sneaking them out of the country and into Europe, where he becomes embroiled in a deadly game of international intrigue. With the president's forces now breathing down his neck in the belief that he has kidnapped Cassie, and his attentions increasingly drawn toward Melissa, whom he has come to care for, Travis becomes distracted enough to make a deadly miscalculation. The tragedy that results will have a monumental effect on everyone involved and may mean the end of any hopes they hold for the future.Johansen is a master at keeping her readers on edge, and Final Target is a perfect example of this master at work. The pace zips, the plot twists, and each turn of the page brings a new surprise.

How homosexual actors and actresses came to define straight America's sexual self-image is only one of the paradoxical and provocative questions explored in Open Secret, a revealing cultural chronicle of gay Hollywood. From the silent era to the age of the multiplex and beyond, homosexuality has been a fact of life in the film industry, and scores of important personalities -- stars, writers, directors, producers -- have enjoyed long and spectacular careers on both sides of the camera, despite mainstream America's professed bias against gays.Part social history and part Tinseltown expose, this entertaining book spans seventy years, painting knowing and vivid portraits of many of Hollywood's foremost gays and lesbians, often in the words of eyewitnesses or the principals themselves. Veteran entertainment journalist David Ehrenstein traces the gradual transformation from an era when gays and lesbians had no public profile in polite society to the modern era when many top entertainment figures are not merely comfortable with their sexuality but actually celebrate it -- and are in turn celebrated for it. In the process, he presents a unique reflection of American society as a whole and its ever-changing attitudes and values.", "genre": ["Queer", "History", "Nonfiction", "Gay", "LGBT", "Film", "Sexuality"], "author": "David Ehrenstein", "rating": "3.43", "pages": "320"}, {"id": 484958, "title": "Cruel and Unusual", "blurb": "Killing me won't kill the beast are the last words of rapist-murderer Ronnie Joe Waddell, written four days before his execution.

He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes. With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing\u2014though absurdly comic\u2014meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

In Pieces of My Heart - Writings Inspired by Animals and Nature the author paints an emotional rainbow with a palette akin to Thoreau, Khalil Gibran, James Thurber, Chief Seattle, and James Herriot. Pieces of My Heart encompasses favorites such as We Are Their Heroes, How Could You?, The Basset Chronicles, and The Zen of Cat, as well as a treasure-trove of new writings. Included is an Appendix of suggestions and resources for helping animals; and a Foreword by Dr. Marc Bekoff, author of Minding Animals: Awareness, Emotions, and Heart and co-founder with Dr. Jane Goodall of Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals/Citizens for Responsible Animal Behavior Studies. Illustrated by Christine J. Head. Pieces of My Heart is a soulful, heartfelt tribute to animals and a plea for compassion.

But Bishop prefers to make up the rules as he goes along. He's willing to beat any man into the ground and draw any woman into his bed in order to get the answers he's after.

What all his books have in common is a growing assurance as you turn the first few pages that you're in good, honorable hands--that the author won't trick you shamelessly or go off on some tedious tangent. So, without losing a beat, a book that begins with a horrible plane explosion that rains down fire over a Massachusetts village can shift seamlessly into a jazz musician's hunt for his lost love and an executive hit man's search for a little girl. When that plane crashes over the small coastal town of Hunnicut (in a scene probably better not read during or just before a flight of your own), 5-year-old Amanda Dodson--a roundish little mixed-race girl with a quiet, thoughtful manner--escapes from her babysitter's burning house and wanders into the woods. That's where her young mother, Carol, who works as a cocktail waitress (and does occasional sexual favors for customers), finds her after an agonizing search. With Amanda is one of the plane's passengers, apparently brought back to life by the girl's formidable healing abilities. Now they'll come after her! Carol Dodson cries, before fleeing with the child to New York City.  In Manhattan, she has a brief encounter with a grieving saxophone genius named Lonnie Blake. Captivated by her resemblance to his late wife, Blake tries to find Carol again, but he is not the only one hunting down Carol and Amanda. Others want to capture the little girl to exploit her amazing healing powers for profit. In lesser hands, these ingredients might add up to nothing more than a shameless potboiler, but Klavan has powers of his own--a magic touch that humanizes even the smallest characters and makes them a part of our own world. --Dick Adler\n...more", "genre": ["Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Adult Fiction"], "author": "Andrew Klavan", "rating": "3.56", "pages": null}, {"id": 486528, "title": "Dave Barrys Bad Habits", "blurb": "To most people, news means information about events that affect a lot of people.

While he's more recently branched out into books and magazine articles, the form where he shines brightest is the newspaper column. Dave Barry's Bad Habits is a cracking-good collection of his syndicated column taken from the early 1980s. And Barry at his best can stand among the greatest humorists America has produced. First of all, let me assure you that we are not in a depression. The key economic indicator of a depression is that you suddenly start seeing a lot of primitive black-and-white newsreel films of people wearing old-fashioned hats and overcoats and forming lines in the streets of major cities to obtain bread. So far, all the lines of people have been videotaped in color, which is the sign of a stable economy. Also, the people have not been lining up for bread. They have been lining up for cheese, which the government has several million tons of.   When you're looking for a good belly laugh, sometimes only Dave Barry will do. Dave Barry's Bad Habits skates from topic to topic, always light, always rambunctious. For the dedicated fan, it's an essential volume; for the rest, it's yet more evidence that Barry is the Zen master of written mirth. --Michael Gerber \n...more", "genre": ["Humor", "Nonfiction", "Writing", "Essays", "Humor", "Comedy", "Short Stories", "Anthologies"], "author": "Dave Barry", "rating": "3.85", "pages": null}, {"id": 486550, "title": "Steve & Me", "blurb": "When Terri Raines was twenty-seven years old, she took a vacation that changed her life.

Leaving behind her wildlife rescue work in Oregon, Terri traveled to Australia, and there, at a small wildlife park, she met and fell in love with a tall, blond force of nature named Steve Irwin. They were married in less than a year, and Terri eagerly joined in Steve's conservation work. The footage filmed on their crocodile-trapping honeymoon became the first episode of The Crocodile Hunter,  and together, Steve and Terri began to change the world. In Steve & Me,  Terri recounts the unforgettable adventures they shared -- wrangling venomous snakes, saving deadly crocodiles from poachers, swimming among humpback whales. A uniquely gifted naturalist, Steve was first and foremost a wildlife warrior dedicated to rescuing endangered animals -- especially his beloved crocs -- and educating everyone he could reach about the importance of conservation. In the hit TV shows that continue to be broadcast worldwide, Steve's enthusiasm lives on, bringing little-known and often-feared species to light as he reveals and revels in the wonders of our planet.With grace, wit, and candor, Terri Irwin portrays her husband as he really was -- a devoted family man, a fervently dedicated environmentalist, a modest bloke who spoke to millions on behalf of those who could not speak for themselves. Steve & Me is a nonstop adventure, a real-life love story, and a fitting tribute to a man adored by all those whose lives he touched, written by the woman who knew and loved him best of all.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Memoir", "Animals", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Cultural", "Australia", "Biography Memoir", "Romance", "Environment", "Nature", "Science"], "author": "Terri Irwin", "rating": "4.37", "pages": "273"}, {"id": 486560, "title": "The Song of Percival Peacock", "blurb": "A playful, complex novel of banter between servant and master.

The answer, for both his admirers and his detractors, is often yes. In Morning in America, Gil Troy argues that the Great Communicator was also the Great Conciliator. His pioneering and lively reassessment of Ronald Reagan's legacy takes us through the 1980s in ten year-by-year chapters, integrating the story of the Reagan presidency with stories of the decade's cultural icons and watershed moments-from personalities to popular television shows.One such watershed moment was the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. With the trauma of Vietnam fading, the triumph of America's 1983 invasion of tiny Grenada still fresh, and a reviving economy, Americans geared up for a festival of international harmony that-spurred on by an entertainment-focused news media, corporate sponsors, and the President himself-became a celebration of the good old U.S.A. At the Games' opening, Reagan presided over a thousand-voice choir, a 750-member marching band, and a 90,000-strong teary-eyed audience singing America the Beautiful! while waving thousands of flags.Reagan emerges more as happy warrior than angry ideologue, as a big-picture man better at setting America's mood than implementing his program. With a vigorous Democratic opposition, Reagan's own affability, and other limiting factors, the eighties were less counterrevolutionary than many believe. Many sixties' innovations went mainstream, from civil rights to feminism. Reagan fostered a political culture centered on individualism and consumption-finding common ground between the right and the left.Written with verve, Morning in America is both a major new look at one of America's most influential modern-day presidents and the definitive story of a decade that continues to shape our times.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Politics", "Nonfiction", "North American Hi...", "American History"], "author": "Gil Troy", "rating": "3.67", "pages": "448"}, {"id": 486942, "title": "Eyelids of Morning: The Mingled Destinies of Crocodiles and Men", "blurb": "This book documents the crocodile's profound influence on the native people of Africa as reflected in their myths, symbols, and everyday lives--and the devastating impact that these people, as well as hunters, explorers, and developers, have had on the crocodile's existence.", "genre": ["Nature", "Africa", "Natural History", "Nonfiction"], "author": "Alistair Graham", "rating": "4.34", "pages": "260"}, {"id": 486987, "title": "Sunshine and Shadow", "blurb": "In Sunshine and Shadow, Johnston's approach again radiates truth, humor, and compassion as the Pattersons deal with the illness and death of Elly's mother.

The family also watches as life goes on: college student Michael's love life heats up and Elizabeth has begun the transformation into a young adult. Through it all, John and Elly raise their brood-Michael, Elizabeth, and April, as well as Edgar the dog-with a liberal mix of love and laughter. Heartwarming and humorous, the Pattersons give readers a reason to smile while emphasizing what's really important in life.\n...more", "genre": ["Sequential Art", "Comics", "Humor", "Comics", "Comic Book", "Sequential Art", "Cartoon", "Graphic Novels Comics"], "author": "Lynn Johnston", "rating": "4.38", "pages": "128"}, {"id": 486989, "title": "All About April: Our Little Girl Grows Up!: A For Better or For Worse Special Edition", "blurb": "April Patterson entered the world of For Better or For Worse in dramatic fashion when she was born at home during an ice storm.

This book, written by one of America's most distinguished science educators, provides essential background information on this difficult and important controversy. Giving a sweeping and balanced historical look at both schools of thought, John A. Moore shows that faith can exist alongside science, that both are essential to human happiness and fulfillment, but that we must support the teaching of science and the scientific method in our nation's schools. This highly informative book will be an invaluable aid for parents, teachers, and lawmakers, as well as for anyone who wants a better understanding of this debate. From Genesis to Genetics shows us why we must free both science and religion to do the good work for which each is uniquely qualified. Using accessible language, Moore describes in depth these two schools of thought. He begins with an analysis of the Genesis story, examines other ancient creation myths, and provides a nuanced discussion of the history of biblical interpretation. After looking at the tenets and historical context of creationism, he presents the history of evolutionary thought, explaining how it was developed, what it means, and why it is such a powerful theory. Moore goes on to discuss the relationship of nineteenth-century religion to Darwinism, examine the historic Scopes trial, and take us up to the current controversy over what to teach in schools. Most important, this book also explores options for avoiding confrontations over this issue in the future. Thoughtfully and powerfully advocating that the teaching of science be kept separate from the teaching of religion, Moore asks us to recognize that a vigorous and effective scientific community is essential to our nation's health, to our leadership role in the world, and to the preservation of a healthy environment.\n...more", "genre": ["Science"], "author": "John A.

Among the significantly short-changed is Raymond Strong Carlisle, an irascible black saxophonist who used to play with the giants of blues music, but now does only about four gigs a year, if he's lucky, with a bunch of sorry old men the business forgot long ago. When Carlisle is shot dead at his home in Rio Mirada, an increasingly crime-plagued burg north of San Francisco, the cops, including lead detective Dennis Murchison and his racist partner, Jerry Stluka, figure it's the tragic result of a nightclub fight he'd provoked the evening before. Their two prime suspects: Arlie Thigpen, a gang tough employed by a local drug dealer; and Toby Marchand, Carlisle's musician son, who'd chafed under his elder's incessant tauntings, and whose white teenage lover, Nadya Lazarenko, witnessed the homicide--but is too traumatized to remember anything about it. However, Carlisle's death is merely a harbinger of worse troubles to come, among them a neighborhood-destroying fire engineered by greedy developers. Regrettably, that cinematic hillside conflagration diverts attention from Corbett's more interesting study of people trying to cope with the inequitable vicissitudes of life. Murchison, for instance, comes off as a conflicted mix of determination and desperation, a man terminally unable to fulfill the expectations of his wife and parents. For Marchand, the challenge is to reject his late father's cynicism and find hope in Nadya's embrace, even as she refuses to trust in something so ephemeral as happiness. Other well-formed players here--from a suspect's strong-willed mother, to a smart and fetching lawyer who confuses Murchison's heart, to a cop-turned-hired killer who isn't so transparently evil as he initially appears--struggle to achieve their own forms of justice in an unjust world. Corbett has a sharp ear for street dialogue and an even sharper understanding of human emotion and pain. For a book that's all about dissatisfaction, Done for a Dime is decidedly satisfying. --J.

This beautiful book assembles and discusses thirty-five of his finest paintings.

This comprehensive critical anthology of American fantasy literature applies the groundbreaking theorems of such esteemed American literary critics as Leslie Fiedler, Richard Chase, and Irving Howe to the genre of fantasy in an effort to delineate the true American tradition of fantasy from the more prominent Anglo-European canon, breaking it down into three distinctive strains:The American Tale: Folk, Tall, and WeirdStories that might be considered fables or legends, much like the epics of the Age of Heroes from the classical eras of Rome and Greece, or the tales of the fairy folk from the European tradition, or the fables of Aesop.Fantastic AmericanaStories set directly within the American historic landscape, much as the Arthurian tradition is set within the confines of British history.Lands of Enchantment in Everyday LifeStories that involve what might be called the American spirit, focusing on worlds that exist in the shadows of our own, just beyond Rod Serling\u2019s famous signpost for The Twilight Zone.", "genre": ["Fantasy", "Horror", "Short Stories", "Fiction"], "author": "Brian M.

Then, in Guam, he investigated a puzzling neurodegenerative paralysis, making housecalls amid crowing cockerels, cycad jungles, and the remains of a colonial culture.

Among the many significant paradigms for understanding both the preservation and use of nature in these regions are biological classification, state forest management, tropical ecology, imperial water control, public health, and community-based conservation. Focusing on these and other ways that nature has been shaped and defined, this pathbreaking collection of essays describes projects of exploitation, administration, science, and community protest. With contributors based in anthropology, ecology, sociology, history, and environmental and policy studies, Nature in the Global South features some of the most innovative and influential work being done in the social studies of nature. While some of the essays look at how social and natural landscapes are created, maintained, and transformed by scientists, officials, monks, and farmers, others analyze specific campaigns to eradicate smallpox and save forests, waterways, and animal habitats. In case studies centered in the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, and South and Southeast Asia as a whole, contributors examine how the tropics, the jungle, tribes, and peasants are understood and transformed; how shifts in colonial ideas about the landscape led to extremely deleterious changes in rural well-being; and how uneasy environmental compromises are forged in the present among rural, urban, and global allies.Contributors:Warwick AndersonAmita BaviskarPeter BrosiusSusan DarlingtonMichael R.

A dogtag beside it in the earth bears the name Ben Gordheimer, a young American soldier who disappeared\u2014and was dishonorably discharged for desertion\u2014during the war fifty years before. To complicate matters for the police team of Keith Tyrell, the adept and ambitious Detective Inspector sent to Tolland, the investigation into the G.I.'s death unearths a second, much more recent corpse whose identity and identification as a blackmailer sets the entire village even more on edge. While Tyrell discovers the killer, long dead, of the G.I. quickly enough, the village of Tolland itself proves to be a harder case to crack. The repercussions of the old murder continue to haunt the memories and disturb the souls of Tolland's inhabitants, while the fact that another killer is dwelling in their midst troubles the placidity of their closely knit daily lives. Their distrust of Tyrell's inquiry and of the avid press only reinforces their tight-lipped secrecy. Tyrell has problems of his own as well, with the envy and betrayals of internal politics among the members of his police team increasingly impeding the progress of the investigation. Neither the village nor Tyrell realizes, though, just how quickly time is running out for them in this case. Then a third dead body further rouses once-sleepy Tolland and confronts the beleaguered Tyrell with another nasty case of murder.\n...more", "genre": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Detective", "Mystery", "Crime"], "author": "Freda Davies", "rating": "3.52", "pages": "288"}, {"id": 491581, "title": "Right in Your Own Backyard: Nature Math", "blurb": "Stories, poems, activities, and games introduce readers to the rich array of math to be found in our own backyards.", "genre": ["Childrens"], "author": "Time-Life Books", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "63"}, {"id": 491589, "title": "Behind the Burqa: Our Life in Afghanistan and How We Escaped to Freedom", "blurb": "Advance Praise for Behind the BurqaWhenever and wherever adults make war, children die and women are subjected to fear and humiliation.

View her insightful and passionate analysis along with a condensed reading and student comments on the course. How does a poet repeatedly make art over a lifetime out of an arbitrary assignment of fate? By asking this question of the work of four American poets--two men of the postwar generation, two young women writing today--Helen Vendler suggests a fruitful way of looking at a poet's career and a new way of understanding poetic strategies as both mastery of forms and forms of mastery. Fate hands every poet certain unavoidable givens. Of the poets Vendler studies, Robert Lowell sprang from a family famous in American and especially New England history; John Berryman found himself an alcoholic manic-depressive; Rita Dove was born black; Jorie Graham grew up trilingual, with three words for every object. In Vendler's readings, we see how these poets return again and again to the problems set out by their givens, and how each invents complex ways, both thematic and formal, of making poetry out of fate. Compelling for its insights into the work of four notable poets, this book by a leading critic of poetry is also invaluable for what it has to tell us about the poetic process--about how art copes with the obdurate givens of life, and about the conflict in art between the whim of fate and the artist's will to choose.\n...more", "genre": ["Poetry", "Criticism", "Literary Criticism"], "author": "Helen Vendler", "rating": "3.62", "pages": "138"}, {"id": 493934, "title": "Notorious", "blurb": "Keely Branscom had always been a little notorious.

His quest for the root of the matter led him beyond the bounds of the conventional in all his musical, written, and visual pieces. The resulting expansion of the definition of art -- with its concomitant emphasis on innovation and invention--earned him a reputation as one of America's most influential contemporary artists.Joan Retallack's conversations with Cage represent the first consideration of his artistic production in its entirety, across genres. Informed by the perspective of age, Cage's comments range freely from his theories of chance and indeterminate composition to his long-time collaboration with Merce Cunningham to the aesthetics of his multimedia works. A composer for whom the whole world -- with its brimming silences and anarchic harmonies -- was a source of music, Cage once claimed, There is no noise, only sounds.

Starting with a nuanced interpretation of consciousness-raising, longtime feminist educator Berenice Malka Fisher develops her philosophy of feminist teaching as a form of political discourse. Through reflection on a series of candid classroom stories, she analyzes knotty problems faced by academics and activists. What counts as knowledge in discussion of feminist issues? Can teachers exercise authority without being authoritarian? What is the role of caring in political deliberation? Should safety be considered when students and teachers address volatile topics? How can feminist and other teachers committed to social justice give serious attention to the intersections of gender, race, and sexual orientation? This groundbreaking book is intended for the beginning and veteran teachers and others concerned with the contribution of education to extending social justice.

These four volumes offer the original scripts from the series, including material edited from the broadcast versions that ran from 1977 to 1981 on PBS stations nationwide.Many believe that Meeting of Minds is the most brilliant series ever to be written for television. The show provides a groundbreaking opportunity to be exposed to ideas by way of a medium not normally known for its intellectual vigor.Indeed, Meeting of Minds grew out of Allen's frustration with the mediocrity of the average network program. He envisioned the show as a stimulating round-table discussion conducted like any other talk show - except that the participants would be actors portraying some of the greatest minds and most prominent figures of history. Accordingly, such characters as Aristotle, Catherine the Great, Oliver Cromwell, Emily Dickinson, Margaret Sanger, Gandhi, Thomas Paine, Cleopatra, Theodore Roosevelt, and St. Thomas Aquinas appear in startlingly effective juxtaposition, their characters revealed through brilliantly conceived dialogue.This first volume features appearances by President Theodore Roosevelt, Queen Cleopatra, Thomas Aquinas, Thomas Paine, President Ulysses S. Grant, Queen Marie Antoinette, Sir Thomas More, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Emily Dickinson, Galileo Galilei, and Attila the Hun.The scripts for Meeting of Minds make for excellent reading, distilling an enormous amount of research into a lively format that has the undeniable veracity of historical fact. The result is unfailingly witty, thought-provoking, and geniunely entertaining.Steve Allen's lucidity and fertile intelligence are evident on every page.

The first is professional basketball's metamorphosis from a fringe sport whose championship games would air tape-delayed at 11:30 p.m., after the local news had already given the scores, to become the big-money sports spectacular it is today, filled with outrageously inflated salaries and egos. The other journey is that of Shelton Jackson Lee himself, who has gone from a skinny kid playing ball on the streets of Brooklyn, sneaking into Madison Square Garden to watch his beloved Knicks, to Morehouse College and NYU film school, to being a world-renowned film director and hoops fan. The book charts Spike's artistic journey from his first college film (Super 8), called Last Hustle in Brooklyn, and his gradual move down from the raucous, nosebleed blue seats just below the Garden's rafters, closer and closer to the on-court action until, in the year Malcolm X was released, Spike landed the coveted courtside seats he has today - the best seats in the house. From there, his blue-seat emotions, transplanted to within arm's reach of the action, have led to numerous confrontations with refs and opposing players - some of them public, like the notorious Reggie Miller incident - but most never before discussed. Along the way Spike takes readers on entertaining and provocative detours, including a one-on-one with that other film-directing, Brooklyn-born, Garden-inhabiting hoops fan, Woody Allen; reviews of sports movies (Spike has seen them all, and the results aren't pretty); an unusually candid and revelatory interview with Michael Jordan; and astark assessment of the role of African-American athletes both in the big business of sports and in the broader culture.\n...more", "genre": ["Sports", "Basketball", "Nonfiction", "Sports", "Sports", "Biography"], "author": "Spike Lee", "rating": "3.44", "pages": "327"}, {"id": 494947, "title": "The Good Housekeeping Book of Child Care: Including Parenting Advice, Health Care  Child Development for Newborns to Preteens", "blurb": "This practical, reassuring, and comprehensive guide to raising happy, healthy children is the only book a new parent needs.

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry. This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series.

But where are the answers? The wounds of the soul require more than the Band-Aid& philosophies offered by the world; they call for a source of healing that only God can provide. Strength Through Adversity explores those healing principles that God has given to help us understand and endure adversity. Gospel principles, understood and practiced, cannot completely isolate us from hardship and heartaches, the author writes, but they can and do insulate us. Though not pretending to set down all the answers, this book provides a gospel context within which readers can increase their understanding and find comfort amidst their personal trials. Addressing the universal why questions, the author discusses three main causes of suffering man's agency, natural law, and authentic acts of God___ and their relationship to the plan of salvation. But, perhaps more important, the bulk of this book deals with the universal what question, What can a person do to find peace and consolation? Comforting insights from the scriptures and modem-day prophets, many of whom have known great personal suffering in their own lives, provide powerful guidelines for overcoming setbacks and experiencing genuine growth in adversity.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Christianity", "Lds"], "author": "Brent L.

While they agree with their predecessors that an important function of writing is the clear, direct expression of thought, they point out that many of our thoughts first come into being only when put to paper. By failing to recognize the link between thinking and writing, we fall into the deadlock innappropriately named writer's block.Thinking on Paper shows how writer's block as well as many other writing problems are engendered by the tendency, supported by traditional approaches, to separate thinking from writing.

They reveal that African American women are at increased risk for psychological distress because of factors that disproportionately affect them, including lower incomes, greater poverty and unemployment, unmarried motherhood, racism, and poor physical health. Yet at the same time, rates of mental illness are low. This invaluable book is the first comprehensive examination of the contradictions between the strengths and vulnerabilities of this population.

It was after moving here in 1883 with his future second wife, Alice Hosched\u00e9, and their eight children that Monet's work finally achieved recognition. His growing success meant that he was able to indulge his passion for comfort and good living.Family meals, special celebrations, luncheons with friends, picnics: all reflected the Monets' love of good food. Just as the inspiration for many of Monet's paintings was drawn from his beloved gardens and the surrounding Normandy landscape, so the meals served at Giverny were based upon superb ingredients from the kitchen-garden (a work of art in itself), the farmyard, and the French countryside.A moody, reserved, and very private man whose daily routine revolved totally around his painting, Monet nevertheless enjoyed entertaining his friends, many of whom were leading figures of the time. As well as his fellow Impressionists -- in particular Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Degas and Cezanne -- other regular guests included Rodin, Whistler, Maupassant, Valery, and one of Monet's closest friends, the statesman Clemenceau.They came to dine in almost ritual form, first visiting Monet's studio and the greenhouses, then having lunch at 11:30 (the time the family always dined, to enable Monet to make the most of the afternoon light). Tea would later be served under the lime trees or near the pond. Guests were never invited to dinner; because Monet went to bed very early in order to rise at dawn. All the guests were familiar with Monet's rigid timetable.The recipes collected in his cooking journals include dishes Monethad encountered in his travels or had come across in restaurants he frequented in Paris as well as recipes from friends, such as Cezanne's bouillabaisse and Millet's petits pains.For this book, the author Claire Joyes, wife of Madame Monet's great-grandson, has spent years selecting the Monets' favorite recipes and writing a wonderfully evocative introductory text. All of the recipes have been artfully prepared and brought back to life in Monet's own kitchen by master chef Joel Robuchon.Illustrated with sumptuous reproductions of Monet's paintings, spectacular original four-color photographs of Giverny, selected shots of finished dishes, and facsimile pages from the notebooks themselves, this book provides a fascinating and unique insight into the turn-of-the-century lifestyle of one of the world's most celebrated Impressionist painters.", "genre": ["Cookbooks", "Cooking", "Art", "Food", "France", "Biography", "History"], "author": "Claire Joyes", "rating": "4.10", "pages": "192"}, {"id": 496452, "title": "Giverny: Un Village Impressionniste Au Temps De Monet", "blurb": "By the end of the nineteenth century, a colony of Anglo-Saxon painters, mostly American, had settled in Giverny.

They were drawn by the beauty of this picturesque village and its surrounding countryside, and by the presence of Calude Monet who had settled there in 1883. The link between the master of Impressionism and the new arrivals was strong: not only did Monet influence their painting style, but socially the artists lived in a close-knit community, enjoying moments of relaxation together before or after long hours spent at the easel.For the first time, this book tells the little-known story of the everyday life of this community: daily meetings at the tennis courts; entertaining in the Butler household (Theodore Butler married Monet's daughter); and the central role played by the H\u00f4tel Baudy. The proprietors of this family-run hotel offered the artists a convivial meeting place, affordable lodgings, and good food, which the artists often paid for in paintings.Madame Baudy adapted her fare so that porridge could be ordered for breakfast and Thanksgiving dinner enjoyed on the appropriate day. Here French chef Monique Mourgues has adapted over thirty recipes from the menus served at the H\u00f4tel and from the Butler recipe book, including dandelion omelet and baked trout from the local river Epte.Illustrated throughout with specially commissioned photographs of the painters' homes and the H\u00f4tel Baudy, alongside period paintings of country scenes and daily life in the impressionistic style, The Taste of Giverny allows the reader to savor the lively atmosphere and gastronomic delights of this small artists' village at the turn of the last century.The fate of Giverny, a quiet village in Normandy, was changed forever when Monet moved there in 1883. Picnics, games of tennis, outdoor teas, billiards tournaments, dinners, and masked balls . . . the numerous artists who flocked to this rural idyll pursued not only the art of painting, but also the art of living.Here author Claire Joyes unveils the everyday activities of the community, the reactions of the locals to their new neighbors, and the central role played by Madame Baud, hotel proprietor, talented cook, and matchmaker.Stunning original photographs featuring the artists' studios, their houses, Giverny itself, and the surrounding countryside, plunge us into the atmosphere of the village as it was at the height of the Impressionist period.\n...more", "genre": ["Art"], "author": "Claire Joyes", "rating": "3.50", "pages": "159"}, {"id": 496471, "title": "Strength for the Journey: A Pilgrimage of Faith in Community", "blurb": "In Strength for the Journey, Diana Butler Bass illustrates the dynamic strength and persistence of mainline Protestantism.

Laing explains how we all exist in the world as beings, defined by others who carry a model of us in their heads, just as we carry models of them in our heads. In later writings he often takes this to deeper levels, laboriously spelling out how A knows that B knows that A knows that B knows...! Our feelings and motivations derive very much from this condition of being in the world in the sense of existing for others, who exist for us. Without this we suffer ontological insecurity, a condition often expressed in terms of being dead by people who are clearly still physically alive.This watershed work aimed to make madness comprehensible, and in doing so revolutionized the way we perceive mental illness. Using case studies of patients he had worked with, psychiatrist R. D. Laing argued that psychosis is not a medical condition, but an outcome of the 'divided self', or the tension between the two personas within us: one our authentic, private identity, and the other the false, 'sane' self that we present to the world. Laing's radical approach to insanity offered a rich existential analysis of personal alienation and made him a cult figure in the 1960s, yet his work was most significant for its humane attitude, which put the patient back at the centre of treatment.

With this addition to Potomac\u2019s Military Profiles series, historian Richard Sauers examines the life of one of the Union Army\u2019s most notable generals. Rising from the Union officer corps to lead the previously ill-fated Army of the Potomac, Meade took command only hours before his forces stumbled upon Robert E. Lee\u2019s Confederates at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in 1863. He led his men to victory in one of the most famous battles in history, but Meade was soon embroiled in political battles with fellow generals and Washington politicians. Despite detractors\u2019 efforts to question Meade\u2019s judgment and smear his reputation\u2014efforts often exacerbated by the general\u2019s own volatile temper and undiplomatic behavior\u2014he continued to put duty to his country and his men first. When Ulysses S. Grant was named lieutenant general in charge of all Union forces, Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac and soon overshadowed Meade. Sauers chronicles the tense relationship that developed between the two men and the effect it had on the crucial last days of the war. Sauers\u2019s concise but authoritative biography sheds new light on one of the Civil War\u2019s most significant leaders.

In his own lifetime meager credit was allotted him for his achievement at Gettysburg, for his long pursuit of General Robert E. Lee into Virginia, and for the furious marches his men were forced into both before and after Gettysburg, until, finally, -in the vicinity of Appomattox Courthouse, he again held the upper hand. And since his death in 1872, frequent criticism has been meted out to him for not following up the victory his troops accomplished.In this account of the man and his achievements, Freeman Cleaves has attempted to sift the truth from War Office archives and records, from private and public documents, to assess fairly the value of his services.The fourth-ranking officer in the Federal Army at the end of the Civil War, Meade was one of that small corps of professional soldiers who ably conducted campaigns both North and South. A graduate of the U. S. Military Academy at West Point, he was a member of the far-famed Army Topographical Engineers, and served under General Taylor in the Mexican War. Plain-spoken, restless, and impatient, he was a familiar figure close to the front in many major Civil War battles, where his sound generalship won the respect of his troops and fellow officers, though Grant later, almost incomprehensibly, gave preferment to Sheridan.Here, then, is not only a picture of the man in full round, but also a stimulating account of the strategies behind the important Civil War battles in which Meade distinguished himself: the Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, and the Wilderness Campaign.

Despite the overblown title, Lang depicts Bormann for the most part as a pedestrian, yet ruthlessly ambitious man, in the end as much manipulated as manipulator. Indeed, there's something pathetic about his end: having at last inherited Hitler's party rank, he found he didn't have the Fuhrer's power. At last the heir to the 3rd Reich, he found the empire reduced to rubble. His instinct for power was a fawning one. Whatever terror he visited upon subordinates, his own authority resided completely in Hitler; & this account underlines Alan Bullock's conclusion that once separated from Hitler, Bormann was a political cypher. But precisely because of his cypher's anonymity, he quickly came to be thought of both as the eminence grise of the 3rd Reich & as the one top Nazi who had escaped from Germany & survived incognito to plot for world conquest. In this respect, Lang's account offers something new, for the author claims the lion's share of the responsibility for locating Bormann's remains, proving Hitler's secretary died by suicide in the hellish days of 5/45 (contra Farrago's 1974 Aftermath: Martin Bormann & the Fourth Reich). The Frankfurt State Prosecutor's report, which identifies the skeleton uncovered in 1972 as Bormann's, is included here as an appendix.

Can creation science reconcile scripture with the latest scientific discoveries?Atheist Universe also answers ethical issues such as: What is the meaning of life without God? It's a spellbinding inquiry that ultimately arrives at a controversial and well-documented conclusion.Other important questions answered in this book:* What, precisely, is atheism, and why is it misunderstood so thoroughly? * If God is a myth, then did the universe appear from nothing? * Does the meticulous clockwork of planetary motion result from mindless random forces? * Do atheists believe that human beings evolved through blind accident from lifeless matter? * Do the splendor and intricacy of life on Earth reveal evidence of intelligent design by a supernatural Creator? * Can atheists prove that God does not exist? * What about Creation Science, and the popular new movement to reconcile Scripture and science? * Have recent scientific discoveries pointed to God's governance of the cosmos? * Did Albert Einstein believe in God? * Does the fact that energy cannot be destroyed lend credibility to a belief in eternal life? * Without God, can there be a valid system of ethics or an objective right and wrong? * Does religion encourage moral conduct and civilized behavior? Is the Golden Rule really such a bad idea? * What is the meaning of life without God? * When we die, are we simply dead like dogs? * Did atheists suffer a trauma in childhood that warped them into blasphemous rebellion? * Because of ubiquitous injustice on Earth, is an afterlife required to redress the imbalance, where evil is ultimately punished and virtue rewarded? * Is atheism just another crackpot religion? * What's the harm in a person's private spirituality? Does humanity have everything to gain, and nothing to lose, through belief in God (even if He's only imaginary)? * Apart from the Bible, is there secular historical evidence of Jesus' miracles and resurrection? * How do atheists explain near death experiences and medical miracles which amaze even skeptical doctors? * Why should a tiny minority of atheists be able to force their opinions on everyone else by banning prayer in public schools?* Since there are no atheists in foxholes, have famous nonbelievers recanted on their deathbeds? * Did Old and New Testament prophecies correctly predict events which actually unfolded during our own lifetimes? * What about the Shroud of Turin and the discovery of wood fragments from Noah's Ark on Mount Ararat in Turkey? * Does the Law of Entropy (or the running down of the universe) contradict evolutionary theory, which asserts that Nature's complexity is increasing? * Is there absolute proof that man evolved from a lower form of life? * Even if you believe that all life evolved from a single cell, how could complex cellular life originate without a Creator? * Is atheism a totally negative philosophy, leading only to cynicism and despair? * Does communism's past embrace of atheism prove that atheism is an evil and failed philosophy? * Was America really founded upon Christian principles by Christian believers? * What is the true, behind-the-scenes relationship between politics and religion in 21st-century America?

Her existence was played out against the backdrop of court life at the height of the age of chivalry and she knew most of the great figures of the time \u2014 including her brother-in-law, Geoffrey Chaucer.

Yet not so long ago, these sorts of districts were relatively rare, and one had to travel to San Francisco or Greenwich Village to experience bohemia in all its glory. The last two decades, however, has seen the emergence of a mass alternative nation, populated by struggling screenwriters, oddball thrift stores, indie rockers, and thousands of coffee houses. It has sprouted in locales ranging from San Diego to Seattle, Athens to Cleveland. In Neo-Bohemia, Richard Lloyd asks, how did bohemia become such an ordinary thing?In this witty exploration of one of America's most successful new bohemias, Chicago's Wicker Park - site of the hip film High Fidelity and launching pad of alt rock stars like Liz Phair - Lloyd shows that bohemia's new status is a result of broader social and economic transformations. As Neo-Bohemia shows, bohemia's creatures of the night, flaunting thrift store duds, piercings, and tribal tattoos, are the perfect labor force for these new industries. They are very creative, yet willing to work odd hours on a freelance basis. And the success of Wicker Park has only attracted more aspiring artists ready to toil in the information and tourism sectors at relatively low wages.Neo-Bohemia is essential reading for anyone trying to get a handle not just on the growing prominence of alternative and hipster culture in America, but on how cities are retooling to become players in the information age economy.", "genre": ["Sociology", "Nonfiction", "Social Science", "Anthropology", "Unfinished", "Urban", "Art"], "author": "Richard Lloyd", "rating": "3.66", "pages": "295"}, {"id": 500326, "title": "Kinship and Gender: An Introduction", "blurb": "In this revised and updated edition of Kinship and Gender, Linda Stone uses anthropological kinship as a framework for the cross-cultural study of gender.

Her insightful narrative introduces new ways of approaching and understanding cross-cultural variations.Stone provides coverage of the field of kinship at the introductory level, but she also explores the major issues and debates in the study of the interrelation of gender and culture. She reviews studies of primate kinship, considers ideas about the evolution of human kinship, and looks at kinship and gender in relation to different modes of descent as illustrated through ten in-depth ethnographic case studies. Stone examines marriage through case studies of marriage in ancient Rome and Himalayan polyandry and she offers a history of Euro-American kinship and gender, as well as an examination of the repercussions of the new reproductive technologies on both kinship and gender.

Then, as today, the United States actively engaged in globalizing its economic order, itspolitical institutions, and its values. Thomas Schoonover argues that this drive to expand political and cultural reach -- the quest for wealth, missionary fulfillment, security, power, and prestige -- was inherited by the United States from Europe, especially Spain and Great Britain. Uncle Sam's War of 1898 and the Origins of Globalization is a pathbreaking work of history that examines U.S. growth from its early nationhood to its first major military conflict on the world stage, also known as the Spanish-American War. As the new nation's military, industrial, and economic strength developed, the United States created policies designed to protect itself from challenges beyond its borders. According to Schoonover, a surge in U.S. activity in the Gulf-Caribbean and in Central America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was catalyzed by the same avarice and competitiveness that motivated the European adventurers to seek a route to Asia centuries earlier. Addressing the basic chronology and themes of the first century of the nation's expansion, Schoonover locates the origins of the U.S. goal of globalization. U.S. involvement in the War of 1898 reflects many of the fundamental patterns in our national history -- exploration and discovery, labor exploitation, violence, racism, class conflict, and concern for security -- that many believe shaped America's course in the twentieth and twenty-first century.\n...more", "genre": ["History"], "author": "Thomas D.

The Demonstration is an important hinge showing how the doctrine of the fourth century with its definitive councils and definitions of faith, opens out from the new testament apostolic and evangelical witness. Presenting the full translation of the Demonstration of Irenaeus by Dean Armitage Robinson, this book offers a detailed theological commentary by Canon Iain MacKenzie on this foundational doctrinal text. MacKenzie sets out the main theological themes throughout Irenaeus' work, and explores his method of systematic theology, Athanasius's dependence on Irenaeus, and Irenaeus' influence on doctrine in the fourth century - particularly the works of Athanasius, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa. Highlighting the importance of this second century theologian for theology today, this commentary and theological interpretation offers an incentive to study Irenaeus in the wider development of Christian doctrine as a cardinal figure in the appreciation of systematic theology.\n...more", "genre": ["Religion", "Theology", "Christian", "Religion", "Religion", "Christianity", "Nonfiction", "Church", "Church History", "Christianity", "Catholic", "Classics", "History", "Philosophy"], "author": "Irenaeus of Lyons", "rating": "4.31", "pages": "294"}, {"id": 501709, "title": "Le Vautour", "blurb": "A body lies on New York's West 17th Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues.

In this book, distinguished scholars discuss recent innovations\u2014charter schools, contracting arrangements, and choice\u2014designed to liberate educators from burdensome bureaucratic controls and improve the level of opportunity for all children.Focusing on the problems in cities, where far too many children have been denied access to quality institutions, the authors examine the lessons to be learned from Catholic schools, site-based management, private entrepreneurs, and specific developments in three cities\u2014New York, Milwaukee, and Chicago. The authors, though realistic about the political and institutional obstacles that stand in the way of meaningful change, foresee the demise of the one size fits all approach to schooling. They envision a system of schools that is dynamic, diverse, performance based, and accountable; one that is supportive of professionals, responsive to creativity, intolerant of failure, and committed to high educational standards for all children.Contributors: Louann BierleinAnthony BrykJohn ChubbChester FinnPaul HillValerie LeePaul PetersonDiane RavitchJoseph P.

Now Jerry Brotton deftly captures this remarkable age, in a book that places Europe's great flowering in a revealing global context.  It was Europe's contact with the outside world, Brotton argues, especially with the rich and cultivated East, that made the Renaissance what it was. Indeed, Europeans saw themselves through the mirror of the East--it was during this age, for instance, that they first spoke of themselves as Europeans. Here is cultural history of the best kind, as Brotton muses on the meanings of Holbein's painting The Ambassadors--which is virtually a catalog of the international influences on Europe--or on the Arabic influence in the burgeoning sciences of astronomy and geography. This global approach offers revealing new insights into such men as Dante and Leonardo da Vinci and highlights the international influences behind Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Along with fresh and original discussions of well-known figures from Copernicus to D\ufffdrer to Shakespeare, Brotton offers a far-reaching exploration that looks at paintings and technology, patterns of trade and the printed page, as he illuminates the overarching themes that defined the age. From architecture to medicine, from humorists to explorers, the teeming world of the Renaissance comes to life in this thoughtful, insightful, and beautifully written book, which offers us a timely perspective on the Renaissance as a moment of global inclusiveness that still has much to teach us today.\n...more", "genre": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Art", "Art", "Art History", "History", "European History", "History", "World History"], "author": "Jerry Brotton", "rating": "3.48", "pages": "264"}, {"id": 501800, "title": "Blood Thirst: 100 Years of Vampire Fiction", "blurb": "In the past hundred years, since the publication of Bram Stoker's infamous book, no literary figure has enjoyed a more horrific resiliency than Count Dracula. In film, television, novels, and short stories, he keeps coming back to life, fed by the vital imaginative energies of a world-wide audience that cannot seem to resist his abominable charms. Aristocratic and urbane, deeply erotic and profoundly evil, Dracula's bloodsucking savagery has cast a mesmerizing fascination not only over his victims but over his readers as well. And, as Leonard Wolf suggests, Vampire fiction...exerts an amazing pull on readers for a reason that we may find disturbing. The blood exchange--the taking of blood by the vampire from his or her victim is, all by itself, felt to be a singularly symbolic event. Symbolic and attractive! Now, in Blood Thirst: One Hundred Years of Vampire Fiction, Leonard Wolf brings together thirty tales in which vampires of all varieties make their ghastly presence felt--male and female, human and non-human, humorous and heroic--all of them kin to the dreadful bat. From Lafcadio Hearn, Mary E. Wilkins-Freeman, Edith Wharton, August Derleth, and Ray Bradbury to such contemporary masters as Anne Rice, Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, John Cheever, and Woody Allen, and in settings as diverse as rural New England and outer space, this collection offers readers a dazzling compendium of vampire stories. Wolf organizes the collection into six categories--The Classic Adventure Tale, The Psychic Vampire, The Science Fiction Vampire, The Non-Human Vampire, The Comic Vampire, and The Heroic Vampire--which allows readers to see the many guises Dracula's descendants have assumed and the many ways they can be interpreted. In his penetrating introduction, Wolf argues that such an arrangement enables us to see the evolution of the vampire from an unmitigated evil to a creature we are more likely to identify with. In a century in which God and Satan have become increasingly irrelevant in the popular arts, there has been an accompanying secularization of the vampire idea. And, as the stories in Blood Thirst will show, sympathy for the vampire has grown as we have become increasingly interested in the workings of the mind. Indeed, the vampire's ability to change over time, to draw into itself such a richness of symbolic meanings, to conjure itself into so many diabolical shapes, may account for the enduring appeal of the literature written about it. Here, then, is a definitive collection for aficionados and novices alike, and whether readers find the vampires who inhabit these pages sympathetic or horrific, psychologically intriguing or spiritually repellent, morbidly seductive or comically absurd, Blood Thirst gives us all something to sink our teeth into.11 \u2022 I: The Classic Adventure Tale (Blood Thirst: 100 Years of Vampire Fiction) \u2022 (1997) \u2022 essay by Leonard Wolf12 \u2022 The Story of Ch\u00fbgor\u00f4 \u2022 (1902) \u2022 short story by Lafcadio Hearn (variant of The Story of Ch\u016bgor\u014d?)17 \u2022 Count Magnus \u2022 (1904) \u2022 short story by M.

Malti-Douglas first analyzes classical texts (both well-known works like The Thousand and One Nights and others still ignored in the West) in which the female voice, often associated with wit or trickery of a sexual nature, is subordinated to the male scriptor. Showing how early Arabo-Islamic discourse continues to influence contemporary Arabic writing, she maintains that today feminist writers of novels, short stories, and autobiography must work through this tradition, even if they subvert or reject it in the end.

Instead, they are battered to death by a thief with a chunk of granite. Their corpses lie undiscovered and rotting for a week, prey to sand crabs, flies, and gulls. Yet there remains something touching about the scene, with Joseph's hand curving lightly around his wife's leg, quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.Their bodies had expired, but anyone could tell--just look at them--that Joseph and Celice were still devoted. For while his hand was touching her, curved round her shin, the couple seemed to have achieved that peace the world denies, a period of grace, defying even murder. Anyone who found them there, so wickedly disfigured, would nevertheless be bound to see that something of their love had survived the death of cells. The corpses were surrendered to the weather and the earth, but they were still a man and wife, quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.From that moment forward, Being Dead becomes less about murder and more about death. Alternating chapters move back in time from the murder in hourly and two-hourly increments. As the narrative moves backward, we see Celice and Joseph make the small decisions about their day that will lead them inexorably towards their own deaths. In other chapters the narrative moves forward. Celice and Joseph are on vacation and nobody misses them until they do not return. Thus, it is six days before their bodies are found. Crace describes in minute detail their gradual return to the land with the help of crabs, birds, and the numerous insects that attack the body and gently and not so gently prepare it for the dust-to-dust phase of death.", "genre": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Novels", "Mystery", "Death", "Literary Fiction", "Literature"], "author": "Jim Crace", "rating": "3.72", "pages": "196"}, {"id": 503201, "title": "Seven Theories of Human Nature", "blurb": "With over a quarter of a million copies sold, Seven Theories of Human Nature has established itself as the classic introduction to Western intellectual theory.

Ranging from Plato's Republic to Edward O. Wilson's On Human Nature, and drawing on philosophy, psychology, sociology, politics, biology, and theology, this admirably lucid volume compresses into a small space the essence of such thinkers as Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, B.F. Skinner, and Konrad Lorenz.  Stevenson juxtaposes the ideas of these and other thinkers in a way that helps us to understand how humanity has struggled to comprehend its nature. We see how Freud's theory of subconscious motivation is directly attacked by Sartre's claim that there are no subconscious acts at all. And how Skinner's theories, which assert the primacy of learned behavior, are undercut by Lorenz's studies of animals, which suggest that complex behavior can occur prior to learning. To bring these comparisons into sharper relief, Stevenson examines each theorist on four points\u0097his speculation on the nature of the universe, his assessment of the nature of man, how he views the ills of the world, and what he would do to change it. This structure enables Stevenson to compare Plato's theory of the philosopher-king with Skinner's idea of utopia in Walden Two and pose the same questions to both: Who decides what is best for everyone else? And how can the misuse of power be prevented? Along the way, we are treated to fascinating analyses of some of the most pivotal and controversial books ever written, including Marx's Das Capital, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, Plato's Republic, and Konrad Lorenz's On Agression.  The revised edition of Seven Theories of Human Nature is more relevant than ever. For the new volume, Stevenson has added an extended discussion of sociobiology, and cites recent books for further reading on such topics as Creationism, nuclear holocaust, and feminism. Brought completely up to date, this classic introduction will fascinate anyone curious about who we are, what motivates us, and how we can understand and improve the world.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Nonfiction", "Psychology", "Science", "History", "Religion", "Sociology"], "author": "Leslie Forster Stevenson", "rating": "3.61", "pages": "136"}, {"id": 503231, "title": "Scared To Live", "blurb": "A dark night, an open bedroom window \u2013 and three bullets that strike from the darkness.

Tarkovsky's films are analyzed in depth, with scene-by-scene discussions.This is an important addition to film studies, the most painstaking study of Andrei Tarkovsky's work available.Contains 150 illustrations, of Tarkovsky's films, Tarkovsky at work, his contemporaries, and his favourite painters.Andrei Tarkovsky is one of the most fascinating of filmmakers. He is supremely romantic, an old-fashioned, traditional artist - at home in the company Leonardo da Vinci, Pieter Brueghel, Aleksandr Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoievsky and Byzantine icon painters. Tarkovsky is a magician, no question, but argues for demystification (even while films celebrate mystery). His films are full of magical events, dreams, memory sequences, multiple viewpoints, multiple time zones and bizarre occurrences.As genre films, Andrei Tarkovsky's movies are some of the most accomplished in cinema. As science fiction films, Stalker and Solaris have no superiors, and very few peers. Only the greatest sci-fi films can match them: Metropolis, King Kong, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Tarkovsky happily and methodically rewrote the rules of the sci-fi genre: Stalker and Solaris are definitely not routine genre outings. They don't have the monsters, the aliens, the visual effects, the battles, the laser guns, the stunts and action set-pieces of regular science fiction movies.No one could deny that Andrei Roublyov is one of the greatest historical films to explore the Middle Ages, up there with The Seventh Seal, El Cid, The Navigator and Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Life' trilogy. If you judge Andrei Roublyov in terms of historical accuracy, epic spectacle, serious themes, or cinematic poetry, it comes out at the top.

Se trata de que cada mujer identifique a sus diosas dominantes (que van desde la aut\u00f3noma Artemisa y la fr\u00eda Atenea hasta la nutritiva Dem\u00e9ter y la creativa Afrodita, pasando por Hera, diosa del matrimonio, o Pers\u00e9fone, reina del mundo subterr\u00e1neo, o Hestia, prototipo de la mujer paciente).Las diosas de cada mujer es, en suma, una gu\u00eda escrita para todas las mujeres por la fuente de su propio misterio, y para todos los hombres encantados por una mujer.\n...more", "genre": ["Psychology", "Nonfiction", "Feminism", "Fantasy", "Mythology", "Spirituality", "Womens", "Self Help", "Religion", "Goddess", "Philosophy", "Feminism", "Womens Studies"], "author": "Jean Shinoda Bolen", "rating": "4.15", "pages": "416"}, {"id": 503418, "title": "Greek Legends And Stories", "blurb": "BRAND NEW!!

Gnostic Apocalypse focuses on the way Boehme's thought repeats and surpasses post-reformation Lutheran thinking, deploys and subverts the commitments of medieval mysticism, realizes the speculative thrust of Renaissance alchemy, is open to esoteric discourses such as the Kabbalah, and articulates a dynamic metaphysics. This book critically assesses the striking claim made in the nineteenth century that Boehme's visionary discourse represents within the confines of specifically Protestant thought nothing less than the return of ancient Gnosis. Although the grounds adduced on behalf of the Gnostic return claim in the nineteenth century are dismissed as questionable, O'Regan shows that the fundamental intuition is correct. Boehme's visionary discourse does represent a return of Gnosticism in the modern period, and in this lies its fundamental claim to our contemporary philosophical, theological, and literary attention.\n...more", "genre": ["Philosophy", "Religion", "Gnosticism"], "author": "Cyril O'Regan", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "300"}]
