[{"id": 2600001, "title": "Long Time No See", "blurb": "In Susan Isaac's Long Time No See, Courtney Logan, former investment analyst, devoted mother, and Long Island housewife, leaves her home on Halloween night for a quick trip to the grocery store. Five months later, her badly decomposed body is found floating in the backyard pool, concealed by the pool cover. Enter Judith Singer, who helped find a murderer in Isaac's 1978 bestseller, Compromising Positions. Something about the Logan case doesn't make sense to Judith, and she becomes so engrossed in the mystery that she actually knocks on the grieving husband's door and offers to help exonerate him. Long Time No See draws on the best of the light, character-driven mysteries, like those by Janet Evanovich and Mary Daheim. Isaac's first- person heroine is impulsive enough to get herself into trouble, yet thoughtful enough to invite confidences. And her voice is appealingly funny and honest. Since becoming a widow, she reflects, when faced with a twist in her investigation,  I'd tried hard not to indulge in the lonely person's Happy Hour: talking to oneself. About a year earlier, in the drugstore, I found myself befuddled, dithering between a condom rack and a display of batteries, and was startled when I heard my own loud voice demanding: 'Why am I here?' But now I gave in and had a chat with me.  Although clever and well-written, the novel's real strength lies in its characterization and in Isaac's leisurely unfolding of the implausible dark side of the perky blonde murder victim. This is a welcome outing from a deservedly popular writer. --Regina Marler", "genre": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Romance", "Humor", "Contemporary", "Crime", "Romantic Suspense"], "author": "Susan Isaacs", "rating": "3.63", "pages": "First"}, {"id": 2600002, "title": "Marea incierta", "blurb": "The Maude Idris anchors in the Thames loaded with all type of valuable materials, like ebony and ivory, coming from Africa.

Take now, for instance, 15,000 feet off the ground in the seat of a baby Nieuport, Archie bursting shells all around me, German Pfalz buzzing around like someone stirred up a wasps' nest, machine guns tracing lines of fire through the air. But not a single bullet-hole marring the canvas of my Nieuport, much less me. Like I said, lucky. A Pflaz roars past, guns chattering. I pull back on the stick hard, pulling up my machine's nose and climbing up after him. I roll to the side and come up right behind. The Hun pilot doesn't even see me. With a grin I get him in my sights and hit the trigger on the paired machine guns mounted on the nose of my machine. They yammer out 650 rounds a minute, tracers lighting the way to the Pfalz's tail. I see smoke pour out in a steady stream and the Pfalz starts to go into a dive, the wind fanning the flames spreading across his tail. He! 's finished. I don't bother watching him go down, not when there are so many other tempting targets to deal with. I climb up to 20,000, the ceiling of my little Nieuport, and look down, spotting another Pflaz some 4,000 feet below. I bank to the left and come down in a dive, putting the Hun directly in my sights. Machine guns roar and the tracers announce my attack, but too late. The Pfalz banks one way, then the other, trying to get away, but I stay on him, my rounds ripping through canvas and cracking framework, looking for a vital spot or the pilot himself. I find it when some rounds reach the Pfalz's engine, which starts to smoke and the machine goes into a long, slow dive, trailing smoke like a flag of surrender. Making a close pass, I give the Hun pilot an ironic salute as he starts to drop, almost close enough to imagine he can hear me, even over the roar of the wind and the crackle of the flames starting to spout from his crippled engine.

In Entitled to Power, Katherine Jellison examines midwestern farm women's unexpected response to new labor-saving devices. Federal farm policy at mid-century treated farm women as consumers, not producers. New technologies, as promoted by agricultural extension agents and by home appliance manufacturers, were expected to create separate spheres of work in the field and in the house. These innovations, however, enabled women to work as operators of farm machinery or independently in the rural community. Jellison finds that many women preferred their productive roles on and off the farm to the domestic ideal emphasized by contemporary prescriptive literature. A variety of visual images of farm women from advertisements and agricultural publications serve to contrast the publicized view of these women with the roles that they chose for themselves. The letters, interviews, and memoirs assembled by Jellison reclaim the many contributions women made to modernizing farm life.Originally published in 1993.A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

It is the profoundly human story of two souls whose brief lives made a difference, a bittersweet saga of tragedy, triumph, and loss, and--above all else--a love story for the ages.", "genre": ["Biography", "Nonfiction", "Biography Memoir", "Tragedy", "Inspirational", "Romance", "Memoir"], "author": "Christopher Andersen", "rating": "4.09", "pages": "256"}, {"id": 2601049, "title": "\u30a2\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5\u306b\u544a\u3050 2", "blurb": "\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u306e\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u30fb\u30e6\u30fc\u30b2\u30f3\u30c8\u306b\u5165\u308c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5\u30fb\u30ab\u30a6\u30d5\u30de\u30f3\u306f\u512a\u79c0\u306a\u6210\u7e3e\u3092\u4fee\u3081\u3001\u30a2\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5\u30fb\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u8868\u5f70\u3092\u3046\u3051\u308b\u3002\u4e00\u65b9\u3001\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6975\u79d8\u6587\u66f8\u306f\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u304b\u3089\u65e5\u672c\u3078\u9001\u3089\u308c\u3001\u8a18\u8005\u30fb\u5ce0\u8349\u5e73\u306e\u624b\u306b\u843d\u3061\u308b\u304c\u2026\u2026\u3002", "genre": ["Manga", "Comics", "Graphic Novels", "Historical Fiction", "Fiction", "Japan", "Comics Manga"], "author": "Osamu Tezuka", "rating": "4.14", "pages": "256"}, {"id": 2601063, "title": "Budda", "blurb": "A story about a biography of Gautama Shiddhartha, the Buddha, who is a religious leader from India.", "genre": ["Sequential Art", "Manga", "Sequential Art", "Comics"], "author": "Osamu Tezuka", "rating": "3.97", "pages": "276"}, {"id": 2601218, "title": "Wanderer, kommst du nach Spa...", "blurb": "In seinem \u00bbBekenntnis zur Tr\u00fcmmerliteratur\u00ab sagt Heinrich B\u00f6ll, es sei Aufgabe des Schriftstellers, daran zu erinnern, \u00bbda\u00df die Zerst\u00f6rungen in unserer Welt nicht nur \u00e4u\u00dferer Art sind und nicht so geringf\u00fcgiger Natur, da\u00df man sich anma\u00dfen kann, sie in wenigen Jahren zu heilen\u00ab.

Despite debate, however, memoirs written about illness\u2014particularly AIDS or cancer\u2014have proliferated since the late twentieth century and occupy a highly influential place on the cultural landscape today.In Treatments, Lisa Diedrich considers illness narratives, demonstrating that these texts not only recount and interpret symptoms but also describe illness as an event that reflects wider cultural contexts, including race, gender, class, and sexuality. Diedrich begins this theoretically rigorous analysis by offering examples of midcentury memoirs of tuberculosis.

Finally, by examining the ways in which the sick speak and are spoken for, she argues for an ethics of failure\u2014the revaluation of loss as creating new possibilities for how we live and die.Lisa Diedrich is assistant professor of women\u2019s studies at Stony Brook University.\n...more", "genre": ["Health"], "author": "Lisa Diedrich", "rating": "4.00", "pages": "288"}, {"id": 2601984, "title": "The Way to Pentecost", "blurb": "Too often we fail claim the authority of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes. With it's startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing\u2014though absurdly comic\u2014meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote, Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man.\n...more", "genre": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Literature", "Philosophy", "Short Stories", "Academic", "School", "Horror", "European Literature", "German Literature", "Novels"], "author": "Franz Kafka", "rating": "3.84", "pages": "201"}, {"id": 2603200, "title": "Justin Morgan Had a Horse", "blurb": "Joel's face suddenly lit up as if he had thought of something for the first time.

In 1791 a Vermont schoolmaster by the name of Justin Morgan comes home with a two-year-old colt named Little Bub. Taken as payment for an outstanding debt, the little colt doesn't seem like he is worth much, but the kindly teacher asks one of his students, Joel Goss, to train him. Joel knows the horse has great potential, and soon word about Little Bub spreads throughout the entire Northeast for his ability to outwork, outrun, outtrot, and outwalk any horse in the area.  This is the extraordinary tale of a little workhorse, who, after being born in obscurity, becomes one of the greatest breeding stallions of all time.

Now a leading researcher in neuroscience and animal behavior shows how, in recent history, scientific claims about sex and gender differences have reflected the culture of the time. Although the conviction that genetics can explain everything is now widespread, the author demonstrates the interaction of culture and environment in the formation of behavioral traits and so provides an important corrective to popular notions of reductionism.Starting with a summary of sex and gender studies, Rogers explains the error of sex biasing, especially the once-assumed inferiority of women. She then addresses several modern studies and investigations, some of which assert that sex and gender differences are the product of genetic inheritance and hormones. Rogers uses laboratory evidence from studies of animals that help illustrate the biologically fluid properties of sex and gender.Sexing the Brain addresses a variety of topical questions: Are there sex differences in how we think and feel? Is language processed in different parts of the brain in men and women? Do social influences have a stronger influence on sexual behavior than sex hormone levels? Rogers concludes that our biology does not bind us to remain the same.... We have the ability to change, and the future of sex differences belongs to us.\n...more", "genre": ["Nonfiction", "Science", "Psychology", "Neuroscience", "Brain", "Science", "Biology", "Gender", "Gender Studies"], "author": "Leslie J.

They follow her life through three failed marriages, numerous affairs, and ultimately a feeling of being nobody in myself, despite years of psychoanalysis and a luxurious lifestyle on two continents among the leading literary, art and intellectual personalities of the day. Winter in Taos unfolds in an entirely different pattern, uncluttered with noteworthy names and ornate details. With no chapters dividing the narrative, Luhan describes her simple life in Taos, New Mexico, this new world she called it, from season to season, following a thread that spools out from her consciousness as if she's recording her thoughts in a journal. My pleasure is in being very still and sensing things, she writes, sharing that pleasure with the reader by describing the joys of adobe rooms warmed in winter by aromatic cedar fires; fragrant in spring with flowers; and scented with homegrown fruits and vegetables being preserved and pickled in summer. Having wandered the world, Luhan found her home at last in Taos. Winter in Taos celebrates the spiritual connection she established with the deep living earth as well as the bonds she forged with Tony Luhan, her mountain. This moving tribute to a land and the people who eked a life from it reminds readers that in northern New Mexico, where the seasons can be harshly beautiful, one can bathe in the sunshine until 'untied are the knots in the heart, ' for there is nothing like the sun for smoothing out all difficulties. Born in 1879 to a wealthy Buffalo family, Mabel Dodge Luhan earned fame for her friendships with American and European artists, writers and intellectuals and for her influential salons held in her Italian villa and Greenwich Village apartments. In 1917, weary of society and wary of a world steeped in war, she set down roots in remote Taos, New Mexico, then publicized the tiny town's inspirational beauty to the world, drawing a steady stream of significant guests to her adobe estate, including artist Georgia O'Keeffe, poet Robinson Jeffers, and authors D.H. Lawrence and Willa Cather. Luhan could be difficult, complex and often cruel, yet she was also generous and supportive, establishing a solid reputation as a patron of the arts and as an author of widely read autobiographies. She died in Taos in 1962.\n...more", "genre": ["Autobiography", "Memoir", "Westerns"], "author": "Mabel Dodge Luhan", "rating": "3.93", "pages": "292"}, {"id": 2603722, "title": "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", "blurb": "Come along, Toto, she said.
